<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE BATTLE OF AMOAFUL.
</h3>

<p>
The firing proved a mistake&mdash;the result
of a false alarm&mdash;so the night passed
without any other <i>alerte</i> or disturbance, and
all remained quiet during the temporary
halt at Prahsu; but the troops heard of
many strange things as occurring at
Coomassie, all deemed by the natives portentous
of its coming fate.
</p>

<p>
In its market-place&mdash;that scene of daily
blood and murder&mdash;where the predecessor
of King Koffee devoted three thousand
victims 'to water the grave' of his
mother&mdash;an aërolite fell, to the terror of the
people; but there came still a greater
prodigy.  A child was born which instantly
began to converse, and, to prevent it having
intercourse with supernatural visitors, it was
placed alone in a room under guards, who
in the morning found that it had vanished,
and that nothing lay in its place but a
bundle of withered bones; and on this the
fetish men argued 'that Coomassie itself
would pass away, and nothing remain
thereof but dead leaves;' and on the same day
and hour that Lieutenant Grant of the 6th&mdash;the
first white man&mdash;crossed the Prah,
there sprang up a mighty tornado, that
levelled the great tree under which the
king used to sit, surrounded by his warriors.
This caused a profound sensation among
the Ashantees, who gathered by thousands
around it in the market-place, which at that
time was described by one who saw it as 'a
den of reeking corpses, shrieking and
tortured victims&mdash;men and women butchered
by hundreds&mdash;where skulls and human
bones lay about as oyster-shells do at home!'
</p>

<p>
By order of the king's fetishmen two
prisoners had knives run through their
cheeks, and were tied up in the woods to
die, as a test of whether our invasion would
be successful.  The idea of the fetishmen
was that, if the victims died soon, all would
be well with Ashantee; but they lived, one
for four and the other for nine days&mdash;so
the nation gave itself over for lost.
</p>

<p>
On the 6th of January&mdash;the day the
fetish-tree fell&mdash;we shed the first blood in that
land of horrors, when Lord Gifford, at the
head of fifty men, captured a village occupied
by an Ashantee outpost, and killed many
of its defenders.
</p>

<p>
And so, till the forward movement began,
the troops were impatient during the halt
at Prahsu, the soldiers making wry faces at
their daily doses of quinine, and still more
so at their weak ration of grog&mdash;only half
a gill per man, or a gallon of rum to
sixty-four men&mdash;and the officers missing sorely
the pleasures of the long, glittering,
flower-laden mess-table, and the charms of the
girls they had left behind them, and of
whom they were reminded by Du Maurier
in some old stray numbers of our friend Mr. <i>Punch</i>.
</p>

<p>
After the troops advanced, the 25th of
January saw our posts pushed as far
forward as the Bahrien river, and a slight
brush which they had there with the
Ashantees showed that they were making
vigorous efforts to concentrate their forces
for a fierce resistance; and on the 31st was
fought the battle of Amoaful, which took
place in the morning, and by eight o'clock
the white smoke of the musketry and the
red flashes of the latter, were spouting in
every direction, amid the dark green and
wondrous leafy luxuriance of the bushy
jungles.
</p>

<p>
The Rifles were in the reserve, 580 strong,
under Colonel Warren.  Thus Dalton, Jerry,
and others were for a time almost spectators
while the fight went on, and the leading
column&mdash;consisting of the Black Watch,
eighty of the Welsh Fusiliers, and two rifled
guns, led by Sir Archibald Alison (son of
the historian), extending as it advanced with
loud cheers at a quick run&mdash;attacked, before
the rest of the troops came up, the village
of Egginassie, upon the slope of the hill that
rises to Amoaful.
</p>

<p>
Prominent amid the greenery could be
seen the red tufts on their tropical helmets,
then the representation of their famous
historical scarlet plumes.
</p>

<p>
The firing here was tremendous, so much
so that all sound of individual reports was
lost, and the din of the conflict became one
hoarse roar.  The enemy used slugs, not
bullets.  Had it been otherwise, not a man
of the Black Watch&mdash;many of whom were
severely hit&mdash;would have remained to tell
the tale.  Major Macpherson (young Cluny)
was wounded in several places, but remained
under fire, propped upon a stick.
</p>

<p>
In five minutes a hundred and five Highlanders,
nine being officers, had blood pouring
from their wounds; but 'Onward' was
the cry, and as the Rifles came up in
support, amid the ceaseless clatter of the
breechloaders, 'for three hours after the
Scottish and Welsh infantry had carried the
village,' says the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, 'the
contest was obstinately maintained in the jungle,
where it was difficult to see or reach the
enemy, and quite as hard for him to know
how the fight went upon other points.
Assailed in their own wilderness, followed
up foot by foot, the Ashantees fought well,
but never gave a fair opportunity for the
shock of a real charge.'
</p>

<p>
As the Rifles advanced through the jungle
in extended order, over ground which the
fire of the 42nd had strewed with killed
and wounded Ashantees, one of the
latter, a colossal black savage, clad only with
a middle cloth and string of beads, propping
himself upon his elbow, shot Jerry's servant
O'Farrel, in the back and killed him on the
spot, as the ball passed through his heart.
</p>

<p>
It was, perhaps, the last effort of expiring
nature; but Jerry responded promptly with
his revolver, and sent a bullet whistling
through the brain of the Ashantee, who, as
he was a man of fine proportions, was soon
after eaten by the Kossos or wild cannibals
of Colonel Wood's regiment, who, as Jerry
said, 'felt peckish' after the fight.
</p>

<p>
A Highlander lost himself in the bush,
and came suddenly upon a cluster of retiring
Ashantees, who shot him down by a volley
and instantly cut off his head, which they
carried away, as no trophy is more prized by
this people than human heads, which formed
the chief ornaments of the king's palace,
and even of his bed-chamber in Coomassie.
</p>

<p>
In the first days of February the passage
of the Ordah followed, and on the night the
troops bivouacked by its shore they were
without tents, and the rain fell in merciless
torrents, as if the windows of the sky had
opened again, while thunder bellowed in the
echoing woods, and green forked lightning
lit up incessantly the bosom of the foaming
river; yet more than ever were our troops
anxious when day broke to begin the weary
march&mdash;to reach Coomassie and grapple
with the dusky enemy.
</p>

<p>
The first human blood Jerry Wilmot had
ever shed was when he pistolled the
Ashantee who murdered&mdash;for murder it
was&mdash;poor O'Farrel.  He had handled his
revolver then promptly, if mechanically, and
thought afterwards&mdash;strange to say&mdash;with a
little sense of disgust over the episode, and
the aspect of the dead negro, his yellow
eye-balls turned back within their sockets,
his fallen jaw, and oozing brain, had actually
haunted him.
</p>

<p>
But since then, in skirmishing, both in the
bush and open, Jerry had, as he phrased it,
'potted three or four more of the beggars,'
as coolly as if they had been black-cocks on a
Highland moor.
</p>

<p>
While the Naval Brigade halted at
Ordashu, the Black Watch, with half a
battalion of the Rifles, pushed on towards
Coomassie.
</p>

<p>
Soon tidings came from Sir Archibald
Alison, saying briefly,
</p>

<p>
'We have taken all the villages, but the
last, before entering Coomassie; support me
with the Rifles, and I hope to enter it to-night.'
</p>

<p>
Fortunately he had been anticipated: the
half battalion was close upon his own, and
with it were Dalton and Wilmot.
</p>

<p>
The slugs were coming out of the bush
as thick as hail, and the advance of the
Highlanders and Rifles along the road that
led to Coomassie was in a form never
before seen in war.  Colonel M'Leod led the
former.
</p>

<p>
Along the well-ambushed road they proceeded
quietly and steadily, as if upon parade,
but by two abreast in file, so narrow was
the forest path.
</p>

<p>
'Forty-Second, fire by successive
companies&mdash;front rank to the right, rear rank
to the left,' shouted Colonel M'Leod.
</p>

<p>
'A company&mdash;front rank, present! rear
rank, present!'
</p>

<p>
'So on,' says the correspondent of the
<i>New York Herald</i>, 'and thus vomiting
bullets two score to the right and two score
to the left, the companies volleyed and
thundered as they marched past the
ambuscades, the bag-pipes playing, the cheers
rising from the throats of the lusty Scots,
till the forest rung again with the discordant
medley of musketry, bag-pipe music, and
vocal sounds.  Rait's artillery now and then
gave tongue with an emphasis and result
which must have recalled to the Ashantees
memories of the bloody field of Amoaful,
where Captain Rait and his subalterns,
Knox and Saunders, signalised themselves
so conspicuously.  But it was the audacious
spirit and true military bearing on the part
of the Highlanders, as they moved down
the road to Coomassie, which challenged
admiration this day.'
</p>

<p>
So great was the roar of musketry in the
echoing woods that, scared by the terrible
and unusual sound, the very birds of the
air&mdash;and brightly plumaged birds they
were&mdash;grovelled in terror, with outspread wings
over the dying and the dead.
</p>

<p>
Many were borne rearward disfigured
for life and frightfully wounded by the
missiles of their hidden antagonists; but
the regiment never halted&mdash;the Rifles
following close&mdash;nor wavered, but moved
steadily on with its national music playing,
until the Ashantees, conceiving it to be
useless to continue against men who
advanced thus, heedless of all ambuscades,
rose from their coverts and fled in yelling
hordes towards Coomassie.
</p>

<p>
'The cool, calm commands of Colonel
M'Leod,' says Mr. Stanley, whom we cannot
help quoting, 'had a marvellous effect on
the Highland battalion&mdash;so much so that
the conduct of all other white regiments
pales before that of the 42nd.'  Frequently
during the hot and rapid march to
Coomassie the Highlanders saw emerging
from the bushes several scores of fugitives,
who found their movements accelerated by
the volleys they received on such occasions.
Village after village along the road heard
the disastrous tidings which the fugitives
conveyed, and long before the Highlanders
approached the place where the king
remained during the battle, he had decamped
because of these reports.
</p>

<p>
King Koffee never for a moment anticipated
a complete defeat, and believed that
he would only fall back in good order to
give us battle at the head of all his warriors
in front of Coomassie itself, and thus obtain
a peace which would at least spare his
palace&mdash;on which he set a great store&mdash;from
destruction.
</p>

<p>
When Sir Garnet Wolseley, with the
main body, was drawing near that place, he
received another despatch from the front.
Sir Archibald Alison wrote to say that he
had given some time to treat.
</p>

<p>
Thus a delay occurred in consequence,
and of this delay the circumstances are not
very clear to the outer world.  It does not
appear from some accounts to have been
Sir Garnet's wish, yet it undoubtedly took
place, and put the troops to some inconvenience
by allowing night to fall before they
entered the place.
</p>

<p>
'Coomassie at last!' exclaimed Dalton, as
he threw himself, panting with heat, among
the luxuriant grass that bordered the now
bloody and corpse-strewn pathway.  'Let
us but take it, lay it in ashes, and then hey
for home!' he added, hopefully.  Yet he
had had two narrow escapes; one ball had
knocked off his helmet, and another had
scarred his left cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, hey for home,' said Jerry, proffering
his cigar-case; but poor Dalton little
knew all that had to be dared and done
before he saw the last of Coomassie!
</p>

<p>
All knew that when the final attack was
made there would be a fierce resistance to
encounter&mdash;a great slaughter pretty certain
to ensue&mdash;no quarter given or taken; and,
like several others in the corps, during the
unexpected halt, Dalton and Jerry were
writing what might prove to each a last
letter to those they loved at home; and as
the former wrote there came curiously and
persistently to memory the last verse of the
song Laura was wont to sing to him of old:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Then think of me! for withered lies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dearest hope I nursed;<br>
  And I have seen, with bitter sighs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brightest dream dispersed.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Is it strange that, after the peculiar manner
of their parting, Jerry's first and longest
letter was not to his mother, but to Bella
Chevenix?
</p>

<p>
'Poor Bella!' said he, in a broken voice,
almost to himself, as he closed the epistle.
</p>

<p>
'You did not part on bad terms?' asked Dalton.
</p>

<p>
'No, thank God!  What made you think so?'
</p>

<p>
'Something in your tone.'
</p>

<p>
'I am writing to her, though she gave
me no hope.'
</p>

<p>
'No hope&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'She quite misunderstands the real love
I bear her, and evidently suspects that I
wish to secure her hand, not because I am
the squire of Wilmothurst, but because she
is in reality the heiress of it.'
</p>

<p>
'She&mdash;what riddle is this?' asked Dalton,
taking the cigar from his lips, and eyeing
his friend.
</p>

<p>
'Did I not make you understand all that
before, old fellow?'
</p>

<p>
'Not quite.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, old Chevenix has no end of mortgages
over my inheritance&mdash;it is well nigh
all his property now; I can't even pay the
interest&mdash;the mater cannot realise how
heavily the old place is burdened, and
what a task my father had to keep it
together&mdash;so times there are when I don't
care if I should be knocked on the
head&mdash;bowled out here.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't talk that way, Jerry,' said the
older man, reprehensively; 'death is too
close to be lightly spoken of thus.'
</p>

<p>
Death was indeed closer than either
perhaps thought.
</p>

<p>
'But there is your mother,' urged Dalton,
after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'She!  It wouldn't break her "noble"
heart, even were it so with me, and I were
lying stiff, as hundreds are now, in yonder
bush,' replied Jerry, with an irrepressible
gust of bitterness, as he snipped the end off
a cigar with his teeth, and, lighting it,
proceeded to smoke, silently and sorrowfully,
while re-charging his revolver for the
coming attack; 'though, if we are to believe
the newspapers, the grief of the "upper
ten," like that of royalty, is something
unfathomable as compared with that of any
of the vulgar herd!'

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE SCARABŒUS.
</h3>

<p>
Before the troops, on the side of a
large, rocky hill, and in the red fiery
light of the setting sun, setting in a sky
where it flamed like a vast crimson globe
amid an orange and amber space that
blended into green and blue overhead, lay
Coomassie, with all its long spacious streets
of wigwam-like houses, built of wattlework
and mud, plastered and washed with white
clay, ornamented with rows of beautiful
banyan trees, and having before the door
of each dwelling a special tree, at the foot
of which were placed idols, calabashes, and
human bones, as fetishes for protection
against evil.
</p>

<p>
It was four miles in circumference, and
its most important edifice was the palace
from which King Koffee had fled&mdash;a central
stone building of European architecture, in
the chief thoroughfare, so spacious that it
included two or three small streets, besides
piazzas for the royal recreation, with arcades
of bamboo, the bases of which were ornamented
with elegant trellis work of an Egyptian
character.  The accommodation was most
ample, as befitted a monarch whom the
State required to possess 3333 wives.
</p>

<p>
'There go the bugles at last, Dalton!'
shouted Jerry, cheerfully, as he sprang up
and drew his sword, when the advance was
sounded, just as the sun went down, and
the troops began to approach this terrible
place, through ground the atmosphere of
which was made appalling by the awful
stench from exposed corpses which lay
about in every direction, and over which
great vultures flapped their wings&mdash;the
dead of past days of local slaughter for
various royal reasons; thus it was dark
when the 42d and the Rifles reached the
edge of the swamp which nearly surrounds
the place&mdash;on three sides at least&mdash;that
horrible and pestilential swamp, with
floating bones and the rotting flesh of the
victims.
</p>

<p>
The first man through it, and actually in
Coomassie, was young Lord Gifford, who
led the way with his scouts till he was
wounded, when the enemy opened fire for
a time; but as the king had fled with his
warriors, the resistance was merely nominal,
and tremendously hearty was the cheer of
the 42d as they entered the place, and the
pipes sent up a skirl of triumph, which
announced that fact to all the troops who were
coming on.
</p>

<p>
Excitement over now, Jerry Wilmot felt
his soul sicken as he marched at the head
of his company up one of the principal
streets, with the awful odour of dead flesh
everywhere around&mdash;victims never being
buried, but left where they were killed, or
cast into the adjacent swamp.  Over all
that town, as a writer has it, the odour of
death hung everywhere, and came on every
sickly breath of hot wind&mdash;'a town where
here and there a vulture hops at one's very
feet, too gorged to join the filthy flock,
preening itself on the gaunt dead trunks
that line the way; where blood is plastered
like a pitch coating over trees, floors and
stools&mdash;blood of a thousand (fetish) victims
yearly renewed; where headless bodies make
common sport; where murder pure and
simple&mdash;the monotonous massacre of bound
men&mdash;is the one employment of the king
and the one spectacle of the populace.'
</p>

<p>
Amid such surroundings the troops piled
arms in the market-place, guards were posted,
and the rest sat down to their rations,
amid the light from blazing houses, which
the native levies began to loot and then set
aflame; while many Ashantee warriors, who
had been but recently fighting with our
men, lingered near the groups quietly,
with their muskets in their hands, saying
ever and anon, 'Tank you, tank you'&mdash;an
attempt at the only English they knew.
</p>

<p>
The Fantee prisoners the troops had come
so far to release were found chained to logs;
and one European, an Englishman, who
was found free, displayed like them the
most extravagant joy on finding himself
saved from death at the hands of King
Koffee.
</p>

<p>
'Is there a drop in your flask, Dalton?'
said an officer, propping himself on his
sword.  'The odour here is literally awful.'
</p>

<p>
'You are welcome to what remains, but
a strong cigar is best, my boy,' replied
Dalton, as he wrenched open a tin of preserved
meat with the blade of his sword.
</p>

<p>
'Now that we are here,' said Jerry,
'what will the next move be?'
</p>

<p>
'Burn the whole place, no doubt, and
then be off like birds,' was the reply of more
than one.
</p>

<p>
'And so end the most hideous and uninteresting
war in which British soldiers have
been engaged.'
</p>

<p>
'What the devil is that?  Trundle it out
of sight,' cried Jerry to a rifleman, who was
dragging near them an object which he had
found, and which proved to be one of the
king's war-drums, ornamented with sixteen
human skulls and thirty-two thigh bones,
and in the cords of which were stuck three
war-trumpets, made each to imitate a throat,
with a tongue of red cloth, and jaws but too
real to form the mouthpiece.  'Take away
the d&mdash;&mdash;d thing!  Who could sup with
that beside them?' exclaimed Jerry, in great
disgust, as the soldier laughed, saluted, and
dragged away the ghastly trophy, on the
resounding head of which some of his
comrades were ere long beating while they sang
some familiar music-hall ditty.
</p>

<p>
As it was expected that King Koffee
might still come to terms, his capital was
not yet given to the flames.  Indeed, he
had sent messengers to Sir Garnet Wolseley
with missives to the effect that he would
be early with him next day and arrange for
peace; but the morning of the next day
passed and noon without any sign of his
coming, though the general and staff were
in readiness to receive him, and all were
restless and uneasy, as it was impossible to
linger long in such a vast charnel-house as
Coomassie.
</p>

<p>
A dreadful tempest of rain made the
adjacent country a swamp, giving a hint
that the fatal and pestilential wet season
was at hand, and the words, 'We must be
off,' were in everyone's mouth.
</p>

<p>
When five o'clock on that day came, and
there were no tidings from King Koffee&mdash;now
that he had betaken himself into the
interior, thus proving himself unworthy of
trust&mdash;it was resolved to leave marks of our
power and vengeance that would never be
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The troops knew that the streams in their
rear would be swollen, that the mere
runnels in the ravines would soon become
brawling torrents, so there was no time to
be lost in getting back to the coast, where
the ships awaited the army, which had only
five days' provisions, so it was requisite that
the campaign should end sharply, surely,
and sternly.
</p>

<p>
The royal state umbrella and various
gold ornaments were taken as presents for
the Queen from the palace, in which the
Highlanders were much exercised in their
minds to find, framed upon the wall of a
room, an engraving of 'Burns and Highland
Mary' beside a bird organ, and various old
clocks, pots, and kettles; stools wet with
the blood of recent human victims, the royal
couch garnished with human skulls&mdash;and
skulls, indeed, adorned most of the rooms,
the floors of which were full of graves.  In
fact, the whole palace, as Mr. Henty wrote,
appeared to be little better than a cemetery,
though in its cellars were found bottles of
brandy, palm wine, and even champagne,
which the discoverers thereof were not slow
to fully appreciate, and drain off to 'The
girls we've left behind us.'
</p>

<p>
At last orders were given that the palace
was to be blown up, the whole town
reduced to ashes, and a start was to be made
for the sea; then the five past days of
continued toil and incessant fighting were
forgotten, and every heart beat happily and
every bronzed face grew bright.
</p>

<p>
On the day the Engineers began to mine
the palace, Dalton and Jerry Wilmot paid
it a visit, and the latter made very merry
about the three thousand three hundred
and thirty-three wives of the fugitive king.
</p>

<p>
Unluckily for them both, the former saw
a gold <i>scarabœus</i>, about the size of a
goose-egg, among the many strange ornaments at
the head of the king's bed, and with some
force contrived to wrench it off, saying to
Tony as he did so, 'An article of <i>bijoutric</i> for
Laura's boudoir&mdash;a souvenir of Coomassie!'
</p>

<p>
The words were hardly out of his mouth
when two tall and powerful savages, who
had been quietly&mdash;if sullenly and
resentfully&mdash;watching the 'looting' of much royal
paraphernalia and rubbish by officers and
men, threw themselves upon him with yells,
while brandishing long straight daggers that
were minus guards or proper hilts, and who
wore each at his neck a human jaw, polished
clean and white, as a kind of order of valour
perhaps.
</p>

<p>
Gesticulating violently, they seemed to
demand the surrender of the <i>scarabœus</i>,
which proved eventually to be a famous
fetish&mdash;famous even as the skull of the
murdered Sir Charles MacCarthy, which the
king had carried off with him as the chief
palladium of Ashantee.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately Dalton had his sword in his
hand, and kept them at bay till they were
expelled at the bayonet point by some of
the Royal Engineers, but when he and Jerry
came forth they were conscious that these
two Ashantees with the jaw-bones were
watching them and dogging their footsteps,
and were menacing them; but anon they
slunk away when Dalton put his hand to
his revolver case.
</p>

<p>
Then they re-appeared again and again to
his great annoyance and irritation.
</p>

<p>
'This looks ill,' said Jerry; 'it is some
state fetish.  Throw the confounded thing
away.  Chuck it at their woolly heads ere
worse comes of it.'
</p>

<p>
'What can come of it?' asked Dalton.
</p>

<p>
'Your assassination or mine before we
reach the coast, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'As for their menaces,' said Dalton, laughing,
'I value them as little as an old troop
horse might a pistol-shot.'
</p>

<p>
But not long after he had cause to regret
not taking Jerry's advice.
</p>

<p>
In a wattle-built house, of which they had
taken possession merely as a shelter from
the heat of the sun by day and the baleful
dew by night, the two friends were
partaking of a kind of 'tiffin' of tinned beef and
biscuits, with a glass of grog, before the
march, when, at an opening which served as
a window, they became suddenly conscious
of two woolly heads and two dark faces,
the gleaming eyes of which were stealthily
watching them, but vanished the moment
Dalton started up.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, Dalton,' said Jerry, 'I don't
like this business at all.  I am not a timid
fellow, nor a very thoughtful one perhaps,
but I have an unpleasant presentiment that
there is more in this matter than you think.'
</p>

<p>
'More in what?' asked Dalton, testily.
</p>

<p>
'This confounded gold beetle that you've
bagged.  Perhaps it is brass.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all.  Well?'
</p>

<p>
'It is said to be some great fetish, and
you may be followed, tracked to the bitter
end&mdash;to Cape Coast, for all I know&mdash;till
it is recaptured, or you, perhaps, made
away with.  You remember the story of the
"Moonstone," published about ten years ago,
and how the possessor of it was followed
about till it was re-won?'
</p>

<p>
'Pshaw!&mdash;that was in a novel.'
</p>

<p>
'And this is reality.  Novels are supposed
to represent real life.'
</p>

<p>
'There go the bugles; the advance guard
is falling in,' said Dalton, as he put the gold
<i>scarabœus</i> in his haversack, and they hurried
forth.
</p>

<p>
At six o'clock in the evening the advanced
guard moved off, and the main body followed
in the dusk, about an hour after.  The Black
Watch remained as a rear-guard to cover the
Engineers and burning party, which consisted
of about a hundred men of the latter
corps.
</p>

<p>
Furnished with palm-leaf torches, they
began the work of stern and deliberate
destruction, and, although grave fears were
expressed that the late tempests of rain
would prevent the streets of thatch and
wood from burning, ere long the retiring
troops saw, with cheers, mighty volumes of
smoke rolling from end to end of Coomassie,
and there was but one regret expressed,
that the flames did not consume the Bantama
(or burial-place of the kings), with the
temples of their hideous and atrocious
paganism, made terrible by the gore of a myriad
human victims.
</p>

<p>
The pipers struck up, and merrily the
Highlanders began their homeward march,
after the officer commanding the Engineers
had reported the total destruction of the
palace, which he mined at four corners, and
brought down like a house of cards.
</p>

<p>
Around it all was in flames, and, owing
to the dampness of the materials of which
the town was built, astounding were the
columns, vast and dense, of black smoke that
rolled, not only over the whole site of
Coomassie, but the adjacent country, while ever
and anon clear, bright pyramids of flames
shot skyward as the retiring troops toiled
round the margin of the corpse-strewn
swamp on their homeward way, with their
arms at 'the slope,' as all were loaded.
</p>

<p>
And so the dire portents of the fetishmen,
that Coomassie&mdash;the City of the Tree&mdash;would
pass away, and nothing remain of
it but dead leaves, were being realised to
the fullest extent.
</p>

<p>
From the nature of the narrow path, the
country through which it lay, and the
obscurity caused by the smoke enveloping the
scenery, the march of the troops was of a
somewhat straggling nature, and proved a
terrible one.  They had barely proceeded a
hundred yards before they had every reason
to rejoice that the rains so greatly dreaded
had not set in three days earlier than they
did.
</p>

<p>
In some parts through which the line of
march lay, the district had become an entire
morass, and in one place, through which&mdash;in
advancing&mdash;they had passed nearly dry-shod
there was a sheet of water nearly five
hundred yards broad, and in another, over
which a narrow wooden bridge had been
thrown, there was a depth of six feet.  'So
King Koffee had calculated on these spring
rains, as the Emperor Nicholas did on the
winter snows, to destroy our troops; but,
happily, both calculated in vain.'
</p>

<p>
It was during the straggling march, caused
by some of these obstructions, that the
catastrophe we have to narrate took place.
</p>

<p>
Again the troops were at times marching
almost in file, and in rear of the last
company of Rifles were the two friends, Jerry
and Dalton, and, leaving their men to be
led by their senior subalterns, they paced
on together, laughing from time to time,
and talking of home and those who awaited
them there, now that the brief campaign
was over, for homeward now went the
thoughts of all; but these two were
unaware that their steps were dogged and
watched surely and stealthily.
</p>

<p>
As they made a little detour to avoid a
more than usually deep pool surrounded by
some straggling palm-trees, they suddenly
found themselves face to face with at least a
dozen of Ashantees&mdash;notably two of them
the fellows with the jawbones.  They seemed
to have sprung out of the earth, so
suddenly did they appear amid the eddying
smoke and misty vapour; and they at once
struck Dalton down before he could utter a
word.
</p>

<p>
Jerry instantly shot three in quick
succession with his revolver, and, knowing the
reports would at once summon succour, he
shouted cheerily, and dragged Dalton to his
feet, but at the same moment was struck
down senseless by a tremendous blow on
the head, and falling&mdash;falling, he knew not
where&mdash;remembered no more...
</p>

<p>
In short, he had tumbled into a species
of nullah or hollow, completely fringed
round with enormous boughs and luxuriant
greenery, where he lay hidden and
undiscovered by the riflemen whom his
pistol-shots summoned, and who searched
the whole vicinity in vain, till they could
delay no longer, as the waters were rising
fast.  They carried off with them Dalton,
who was severely wounded by dagger-blades,
and whose haversack had been cut
away, and taken, and with it, of course,
the unlucky <i>scarabœus</i>.
</p>

<p>
And so, while poor Jerry lay where we
have described, the army pushed on its
homeward way, and ere long found the
obstructions increase as the night advanced.
Where there had been a small stream at
one place the water was three hundred
yards wide and five feet deep.  With great
toil the Engineers bridged this by felling a
huge tree, over which the white troops
defiled slowly, while the carriers and others
had to splash their way through as best
they could, and many of the shorter men
disappeared under the surface more than once.
</p>

<p>
A worse obstruction still was encountered
at Ordah, where the water had risen two
feet above the bridge built by the Engineers,
and was more than five feet deep in the
mid-channel, and there the shorter men had
all to be assisted by their comrades who
could swim.  Another day crept on, and by
five o'clock in the afternoon the whole of
the white troops had succeeded in crossing
the half-hidden bridge; but darkness was
coming on, the river was rising fast, and for
all they knew the Ashantees, infuriated by
the destruction of Coomassie, might be
pouring in wild hordes upon their rear!
</p>

<p>
Dalton's wounds had been dressed, but
ere that was done he had lost so much
blood that his chances of recovery seemed
very precarious; and meanwhile how fared
Jerry Wilmot?
</p>

<p>
When he struggled back to consciousness,
and half raised himself out of the place in
which he lay by grasping the branch of a
bush, he found himself alone, and
surrounded by dead silence.  Not a sound
fell on his ear, and at a little distance he
could see the red smouldering flames of
Coomassie.  But where were the troops?
</p>

<p>
'Oh, God, help me!' he wailed out.
'Gone&mdash;gone, and I am left alone and
helpless behind them!'
</p>

<p>
There was a gleam of moonlight now,
and after several futile efforts, for his senses
reeled like those of one intoxicated, he
made out the hour on his watch.
</p>

<p>
'Midnight&mdash;and they have been six hours
on the march!'
</p>

<p>
He had been in a state of semi-unconsciousness
for some two hours.  The sense&mdash;the
conviction that he must instantly do
something&mdash;attempt to overtake them, made
him struggle up desperately, feebly, and
half blinded in his own blood.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Lord,' thought Jerry, 'I shall lose
the little reason I have left!  Why did
Dalton covet that infernal beetle!'
</p>

<p>
Alone&mdash;alone at Coomassie.  Was not
this some horrible nightmare, and not a
reality, crushing and bewildering? for but
two fates seemed to await him.  If he did
not die of hunger in the wilderness, he
would be sure to be tracked and taken;
and then, if not killed at once, he would
be doomed to a lingering death by torture
in Coomassie, or what remained of
it&mdash;tortures such as devils alone could devise.
</p>

<p>
He made an attempt to stand, but all
power of volition seemed to have left him;
he fell again into the leafy hollow, and for
a time remembered no more.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE LOST ONE.
</h3>

<p>
And where all this time was Alison
Cheyne, after whom&mdash;as the chief of
our <i>dramatis personæ</i>&mdash;we must needs look
now?
</p>

<p>
When consciousness returned to her, after
wildly grasping the bell in the porte-cochère
of a large house on that night of snow and
terror, and when, fluttering, her white
eyelids unclosed, after what seemed a long
sleep, she looked round her like a little
scared bird, in utter bewilderment, and,
believing that she was dreaming, closed them
again.
</p>

<p>
A bell ringing at a distance roused her,
and she looked again, and became convinced
that what she looked on was no dream, and
her eyes wandered about with a dazed
expression.
</p>

<p>
She was in a little room, with whitewashed
walls, and a floor of plain polished wood,
on which lay a tiny patch of faded carpet.
The sunbeams were creeping through the
closed blinds, and a fire burned cheerfully
in a little black iron stove.  She lay in a
pretty bed, with the softest of pillows and
sheets; it was of plain iron, and without
curtains.
</p>

<p>
Above the mantelpiece, in a simple frame,
hung an engraving from Rubens' picture of
'St. Theresa interceding for the Souls in
Purgatory,' the three principal souls being&mdash;in
a spirit of waggery&mdash;faithful portraits
of the artist's three wives.  On one side of
this was a little Madonna on a bracket, with
a red crystal lamp hung before it; on the
other a crucifix, below which was a tiny
font of Antwerp china.
</p>

<p>
Other ornaments&mdash;save a few flowers in
a vase&mdash;the apartment had none, and its
furniture&mdash;two cane-seated chairs and a
deal table&mdash;was of the simplest kind.
</p>

<p>
In one of the chairs sat a young woman
dressed like a nun, with a black robe and
white hood, a large bronze crucifix and
wooden beads at her cord girdle; her
down-cast face had a sweet, placid, and even
beautiful expression, and she was sedulously
working, with the whitest of hands, at a
large piece of gold embroidery on cloth of
silver&mdash;a portion of a priest's vestments
apparently, while glancing attentively from
time to time down on her patient or up at
two pretty little love-birds in a brass cage.
</p>

<p>
Alison took in all these details at one
rapid glance, and great terror seized her
that something strange had befallen her,
that she was in the care of a nursing sister.
</p>

<p>
'Where am I?' she said, faintly.
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven, you speak, and rationally
at last,' said her attendant, casting aside her
embroidery and coming softly to her side,
laid her cool hand gently on Alison's
forehead.  'Pauvre enfant! pauvre enfant!' she
repeated, caressingly.
</p>

<p>
'But <i>where</i> am I, and <i>who</i> are you?'
asked Alison, in a weak but impatient
manner.
</p>

<p>
'I am Sister Lisette, and you are safe,
safe with friends, and ere long your own
people will soon be here to inquire for
you.'
</p>

<p>
'My friends,' she murmured, with a puzzled
expression, as her thoughts now went
back to her father's sick-room in the Hôtel
St. Antoine; to Cadbury, at the thought of
which she shivered; to the Bal Masqué at
the theatre; the Café au Progrès, and
the insolence of 'Captain Smith;' her flight
through the snowy streets; her fall at the
door of a house, the nature of which she
knew not; all these things floated dimly and
dreamily before her now, though they
seemed to have happened but a few hours
ago.
</p>

<p>
'How fortunate that you had the power
to ring our bell before you fainted, child,'
said the nun, caressing her and kissing her
cheek.  'You might have died in the snow
otherwise.'
</p>

<p>
'Last night?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;child&mdash;it was several nights ago.'
</p>

<p>
'Several?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, papa! has he been here?'
cried Alison, feebly, in great anguish of
mind, yet unable from weakness to raise
her head from the pillow.
</p>

<p>
'No, for doubtless he knew not where
you were.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, he will be dead&mdash;dead with terror!'
wailed Alison.  'Am I in a hospital?'
</p>

<p>
'No, child, in my house,' said the nun,
sweetly.
</p>

<p>
'Your house?' queried Alison, with very
open eyes.
</p>

<p>
'In the Beguinage, in the Rue Rouge.'
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that both Sir Ranald and
Lord Cadbury had utterly failed to trace
her, and fortunate it was indeed for Alison
that she had fallen into such good hands as
those of the Beguines, who are a religious
order, altogether peculiar to Belgium, each
nun having a private residence of her own
within the general enclosure.
</p>

<p>
The clatter of the ponderous bell, as the
pull left her hand, had soon brought aid to
her.  She was denuded of her wet and sodden
attire, put to bed in the little mansion
occupied by Sister Lisette, and, before the
angelus bell rang in the chapel next
forenoon, she was in a highly feverish state,
and in a delirium which lasted several nights
and days, with intermissions of fretful sleep,
during all of which time nothing coherent
could be gleaned from her as to her name,
or where she resided, whence she came, and
how it was that she was abroad in the
streets alone and in such a night.
</p>

<p>
Her little ravings led them to know that
she was English; her costume, and the
delicacy and beauty of her person, that she was
undoubtedly a lady; but, save a ring or
two, she had no purse, card-case, or aught
to indicate who she was; but the name of
'Alison' worked upon some of her clothing
at once interested deeply Sister Lisette, who
was also an Alison, but adopted the French
diminutive of it.
</p>

<p>
The poor Beguines were quite uncertain
what else they could do with her, but keep
her till she grew well enough to be
questioned; so she remained there in her little
iron bed, tended by Lisette, unconscious
and fever-stricken, while the lengthening
days passed slowly over her aching head.
</p>

<p>
Nearly a fortnight passed before she
began mentally to drift back to consciousness,
so terribly had all she had undergone
of late&mdash;the collision at sea with the <i>Black
Hound</i> of Ostend, the nursing of her querulous
father, her separation from Bevil
Goring, and the worry incident to Cadbury's
wooing, culminating in that night of
terror in the streets&mdash;told upon her sensitive
nature and delicate frame.
</p>

<p>
A sweet picture she made, in her little
white bed in the plain bare room of the
kind Beguine, who never left her even for
prayers, but said them by her side on her
knees when the angelus or elevation bells
rang.  Among the huge, soft pillows the
slight figure of Alison was half buried, yet
the soft tints of her face and hair came out
in a species of relief from them; the former
was pale&mdash;very pale&mdash;and there were dark
circles under the eyes; and the gentle young
Beguine who watched her thought she had
never looked on anyone so lovely, and often
sat on a tabourette at the side of the couch,
keeping her hand caressingly within her
own, and counting the jewels in her rings
one by one as a child might have done.
</p>

<p>
'She has a gentle expression in her eyes,
such as I have often seen in those of a <i>Sœur
de Charité</i>, and other nursing sisters,' was
the dictum of the reverend mother of the
establishment, who came from time to time
to visit the fair waif who had been so
suddenly cast upon their tenderness; and, truth
to tell, there was a great touch of melancholy
about the eyes and features of Alison
Cheyne now, though certainly melancholy
was by no means one of her characteristics
naturally.
</p>

<p>
The Beguines, we have said, are a
religious order peculiar to Belgium, and
totally unlike any other in so far that they are
bound by no vows; they may return to the
world whenever they please; but it is their
boast that no sister has ever been known to
quit the order after having once entered it.
They attend to the sick in the Beguinage,
and frequently go out as nurses in the
hospitals.
</p>

<p>
They were among the few religious
communities not suppressed by Joseph II. or
swept away by the furious torrent of the
French Revolution.  Each Beguinage&mdash;more
especially in Ghent, where the sisterhood
averages six hundred in number&mdash;is a
species of little town by itself, with streets
and squares, having gates, and sometimes
surrounded by a moat as well as a wall,
especially at Bruges.
</p>

<p>
The sisters live generally in separate
houses, on the doors of which are inscribed,
not the name of the occupant, but of some
saint adopted as her patron or protectress;
and many of them are persons of rank and
wealth; hence it was in the private house
of Sister Lisette that Alison found herself now.
</p>

<p>
Many writers ascribe the institution of
the Beguines to St. Begga, widow and
abbess, daughter of Pepin of Landen,
whose husband, mayor of the palace, was
killed while hunting, after which she
dedicated herself to a penetential state of
retirement, and built seven chapels on the
Meuse, in imitation of the seven great
churches of Rome; and, according to the
martyrology, she died so long ago as 698.
Others assert that the Beguines were
founded by Lambert de Begue or Balbus, a
pious priest, of Liege, in 1170, and derive
their name from him; but all this lies apart
from our story.  Suffice it that, fortunately
for herself, it was in the spacious Beguinage
of Antwerp that Alison found succour,
shelter, and protection.
</p>

<p>
Alison had often seen nuns, but never
spoken to or been intimate with one before,
and, as all she knew of such recluses was
derived through the medium of novels
and romances, when strength returned
to her she began to invest Sister Lisette
with the halo of fiction, and to suppose
that she must have some story&mdash;that a
lost lover or a broken heart accounted for
her sweet sadness of face and her present
vocation; and she was nearer the truth in
her guess than she imagined, for Sister
Lisette had once been&mdash;for a brief time&mdash;a
happy wife, of which more anon; and
when Alison grew stronger, and was taken
as far as the chapel, she was greatly
impressed by all she saw and heard there at
vesper time, though the chanting of female
voices only&mdash;some of them from age far
from melodious&mdash;was pleasing, and the
sight of such a large assemblage of recluses
in black robes with white veils&mdash;the ancient
Flemish <i>faille</i>, which they yet retain&mdash;dimly
illuminated by a few votive lamps, had a
strange, weird, and, to her eyes, mysterious
effect.
</p>

<p>
The novices are distinguished by a
different costume, and those who have just
taken the veil wear a chaplet round their
heads.
</p>

<p>
But in all this we are anticipating, for at
present Alison was weak as a child, and
prostrate with the effect of the short, sharp
fever that had left her, though it was
apparent to those who watched her that the
lines of her face were fine, and they could
see that, when well and happy, she must
look very beautiful.
</p>

<p>
In Sister Lisette Alison found an able
nurse, for she had served as one in the
German war under the Red Cross; her soft,
white hand had dressed many a ghastly
wound and closed many a glazing eye, and
often amid the horrors of Sedan and elsewhere
the heads of the dying had rested on
her bosom, and with low, loving words she
had soothed their moments of death and
agony&mdash;words that were sometimes taken
for those of mother, or wife, or some young
love that was far, far away.
</p>

<p>
Sister Lisette seemed about five-and-twenty
years of age; her face was delicately
fair, but the rich tint of her lips and the
peach-like bloom of her cheeks relieved it
of all paleness.  Her features were small
and regular, but very soft in their lines,
and, at times, a singular sadness stole over
them.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were of the clearest and darkest
hazel, and full of 'soul's light,' imparted
to her face a world of expression; but
what the colour of her hair (or what
remained of it) was, it would be impossible
to say, as every vestige of it was closely
hidden by her tightly-fitting white wimple.
</p>

<p>
'And I have been here for days and
nights ill,' said Alison, faintly, as
consciousness came fully back to her, and Lisette,
while propping her pretty head upon her
own breast, gave her soothing drink.  'Oh,
what a trouble I must have been to you!'
</p>

<p>
'No trouble at all, ma sœur,' replied the
other, letting her head tenderly down on
the pillow, and smoothing out the latter.
</p>

<p>
'So long, so long, and without papa
being informed,' exclaimed Alison, as tears
of dismay started to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Child, we know not his name&mdash;his
address&mdash;even of his existence.'
</p>

<p>
Alison sighed deeply.  She was too
prostrate in body and even mind to regard
anything as very extraordinary, even her
unusual surroundings in the convent; yet she
longed for her father to come to her, or to
have tidings of him; of aught else she said
nothing.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, if I should die without seeing papa
again!' said she, wringing her hands.
</p>

<p>
'One can die but once,' said Sister Lisette,
placidly.  'You are too strong and too
young to die, though those who die are
sometimes better off than those who are left
in the world.  You, at least, have all your
life to look forward to.'
</p>

<p>
'And you?'
</p>

<p>
'Mine is ended.'
</p>

<p>
'Ended!'
</p>

<p>
'In the world at least, as I shall go back
to it no more.'
</p>

<p>
Seeing that Alison was in a fever of
impatience to hear tidings of her father, Sister
Lisette, on obtaining his name and address
at the Hôtel St. Antoine, at once sent a
messenger with that letter which, as we
have described, so greatly startled and
agitated the old man; and Alison remained in
a fever of impatience, awaiting the return of
that messenger who might perhaps bring
her very crushing tidings.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest papa will not lose a moment in
coming to me,' she murmured, partly to her
nurse and partly to herself; but how, if he
were too weak to come or in despair at her
loss had left Antwerp, or perhaps&mdash;oh
Heavens!&mdash;have sunk under it, and&mdash;died!
And to see him again would be, of course,
to see that odious Lord Cadbury; and so
she tormented herself till the messenger
returned with tidings that her father was well
and had been out and about for days,
despairingly searching for her, and would be
with her very soon.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, thank God for that!' said Alison,
and a hot shower of joyful tears relieved
her; and now she started up at every sound,
and inquired again and again the exact
distance between the Beguinage and the
Marche aux Souliers.
</p>

<p>
'Ma sœur Alison, you must not speak so
much and be so impatient,' said the Beguine,
holding up a finger.
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;you know my name?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, it is mine also.'
</p>

<p>
'But how?'
</p>

<p>
Then the Beguine told her how she had
become aware of it; and that she too was
an Alison, Lison or Lisette&mdash;it was all
one&mdash;and as she spoke her hearer's memory
went back to that day with the buckhounds
on which our story opens, when Bevil
Goring expressed some surprise at her name,
and she had explained that it was an old
Scoto-French one, and common to the
Cheynes of Essilmont; and as she thought
of him she pressed his ring to her lips, as if
it had been some sacred relique.
</p>

<p>
'How well you speak English,' said Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Because I was educated in the English
convent at Bruges,' replied the sister; 'but
hark, there is a voiture at the gate&mdash;monsieur
has come!'
</p>

<p>
'Papa,' murmured Alison, in a choking
voice, as she felt herself become a very
child again, and another minute saw his
arms around her, and her face upon his
breast, while she indulged in a passionate fit
of weeping, and he with difficulty restrained
his tears.
</p>

<p>
Alison then, after a little time, looked
earnestly in his face, and was shocked to
see how wan, and thin, and pinched it had
become; for indeed, during the mystery
that enveloped her disappearance, he had
undergone terrible mental agony and much
bodily fatigue, for with all his selfishness he
loved Alison as the only link that bound
him to earth.
</p>

<p>
Her narrative of how she missed Lord
Cadbury in that crowded place, the Théâtre
des Variétés, to which she should never
have gone, tallied completely with that of
the former; but it was not until next day
that she detailed fully the manner in which
she had been lured by 'Captain Smith' to
the Café au Progrès, and the terror with
which she had fled from that place into the
snowy street.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Smith!' exclaimed Sir Ranald
through his set teeth, while his eyes sparkled
with rage.  'Could I but meet that person,
old as I am, I would give him cause long
to remember the weight of my cane, the
scoundrel.  I must write to Cadbury on the
subject and inquire.'
</p>

<p>
'Write!&mdash;is Lord Cadbury gone?' asked
Alison, timidly and hopefully.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, back to London; he was telegraphed for.'
</p>

<p>
Alison gave a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
'Shall we go home now, papa&mdash;I mean
when I am well enough to be about?'
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald paused before replying.  Had
she relented towards Cadbury with a desire
to see him, or was it a longing to be near
'that fellow Goring' which prompted the
question?  One fact seemed pretty evident,
that she and the latter knew nothing of each
other's movements, and that she was utterly
oblivious of his being or having been in
Antwerp.
</p>

<p>
'Home&mdash;to where?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Chilcote, papa.'
</p>

<p>
Her reply was perfectly straightforward,
though it again suggested ideas of Bevil
Goring, but Sir Ranald deemed that he
must have 'effectually crushed that fellow's
presumption by the rough tenor of their
last meeting.'
</p>

<p>
'Chilcote it shall be then, perhaps,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes, papa; it is so quiet there, even
amid our little troubles,' said she, as he left
her, when the Beguinage gates were closed
for the evening; 'and all I want is peace
and rest&mdash;peace and rest.'
</p>

<p>
'Shall you ever get them in this world?'
asked Sister Lisette.
</p>

<p>
Alison regarded her wistfully, and said,
</p>

<p>
'Why not?  Can you have led a stormy life?'
</p>

<p>
'Far from it.  My life in the world was
a happy one till one dire calamity fell upon
me, and drove me to find peace for ever
here; but how true it is "that it is vain to
try to knit up the present with the past;
each part of our lives has its own pleasures
and hopes."  But now my pleasure is to do
good&mdash;my only hope to die soon and well.'
</p>

<p>
'And the calamity to which you refer?'
asked Alison, softly, while greatly interested
by the singularly sweet and subdued manner
of the young Beguine.
</p>

<p>
'Was the death of my dear, dear husband,'
replied the sister; and so, while she sat
stitching away at the shining garment,
resplendent with gold&mdash;a priest's vestment&mdash;for
old Père Leopold of the Church of St. André,
she told Alison some of her experiences
in life, and amid them, curious to relate,
there occurred repeatedly a name with
which the reader is already familiar.
</p>

<p>
Alison had a sweetly sympathetic way
with her, and her namesake was seized by
one of the unaccountable fits of confidence
that, come to most of us at times to speak
about herself, and tell the story of her own
sorrows.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
A YEAR OF JOY.
</h3>

<p>
A very simple circumstance&mdash;an
occasion of every-day life&mdash;a railway
journey, brought about the awful tragedy
in her life, by which she was left a widow
at twenty, after being wedded a year&mdash;which
she called a year of joy, left without
a near relation in the world but her brother,
Victor Gabion, a captain of Artillery, who,
strange to say, was the source of all her
sorrow.
</p>

<p>
'After leaving the English convent at
Bruges, I returned to the house of my
guardian, M. Hoboken, a merchant in the
Avenue du Commerce here.  My parents
were dead; I had but one brother, Victor
Gabion, to whose brother officer Lucien I
had been betrothed by them, and whom I
had known from his early boyhood, when
we had been playmates together, and before
we came to those restrictions in intercourse
peculiar to French and Belgian society in
later years.
</p>

<p>
'We had learned to love each other very
much, Lucien and I, though now we could
only see each other at given times, and
always in presence of a third party; and
each time I seemed to discover some
fresh trait in his disposition which rendered
him more worthy of love and more worthy
of the tenderest affection.
</p>

<p>
'He was so handsome, my Lucien, so
kind, so tender; and so good, so religious
and true!  He had that dark southern
beauty which makes a man so attractive to
a fair woman, and, moreover, he possessed
that charm which is more attractive and
dangerous still&mdash;he was interesting.'
</p>

<p>
Alison thought of her own <i>fiancée</i>, Bevil
Goring, and believed she could understand
all this to the fullest extent.
</p>

<p>
'His means were ample and his position
good, for, apart from his rank in the
artillery, he was the representative of
the Volcarts, one of the seven <i>Families
Patriciennes d'Anvers</i>, whose seven
coats-of-arms, all bearing a <i>fesse checky</i> you
may see at this hour carved in the ancient
Steyne of Antwerp.  But why think of or
boast of such things, when life, we are told,
is but a dream, and often a very painful and
feverish one!
</p>

<p>
'I have told you that I was educated in
the convent at Bruges with English girls
and English ladies.  Hence I picked up
among them some of that genuine and
honest freedom of action which they
understood and enjoyed; so when my betrothal
to Lucien was fully known, and even the
time of our marriage stated, we contrived
to have more than one pleasant meeting
unknown to my grim guardian, M. Hoboken,
whose absorption in business, and often long
absence at the Bassin du Kattendyk, and
even at Flushing, afforded us facilities we
could not otherwise have had.
</p>

<p>
'But in all this there was a dire fatality,
and I shall never forget the day that
brought it about.
</p>

<p>
'M. Hoboken was to be absent at Flushing
for two days, and madame was an invalid&mdash;unable
to go abroad.  I met Lucien by
appointment in one of the solitary walks, in
the quiet park near the Avenue du Commerce,
with a gift I had procured for him,
when within a week of our marriage.
</p>

<p>
'"Look what I have brought for you!"
said I, as I opened a morocco case containing
an armlet of silver, like an Indian bangle&mdash;you
know what I mean&mdash;flat and broad, and
closed by a spring lock.  In raised letters
on the outside was my name, Alison, with
the date of our coming marriage.
</p>

<p>
'"You are my prisoner already," said I,
laughingly, as I fitted the band round his
wrist, and the spring closed with a snap,
thus it could neither fall off nor pass over his hand.
</p>

<p>
'"My dear love!" he exclaimed, and
pressed me passionately to his breast.
</p>

<p>
'"Now, you are most completely mine,"
I whispered; "fettered for life&mdash;as without
my aid you can never get it off."
</p>

<p>
'"Why?"
</p>

<p>
'"Because I shall keep the key," said I,
and coquettishly dropped it into my bosom.
</p>

<p>
'"Even as you have the key to my
heart," he added,
</p>

<p>
'After a pause he said,
</p>

<p>
'"M. Hoboken is still at Flushing?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes&mdash;and does not return till to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
'"Très bien!" said Lucien, "by what hour,
at the utmost, may Madame Hoboken miss
you&mdash;or require you?"
</p>

<p>
'"By seven certainly, and she supposes
me to be at the Beguinage&mdash;and so will ask
no questions, to put me in a false position."
</p>

<p>
'"Seven&mdash;it wants eight hours of that
time.  See, Lisette, how lovely the day is&mdash;
how bright the sun, and how beautiful the
white and pink hawthorn that load the air
with fragrance."
</p>

<p>
'"Well, what of that?"
</p>

<p>
'"Does not such a day make you long to
leave dusty Antwerp behind you, and to
roam in the country?"
</p>

<p>
'"It does indeed; but I dare not think
of such a thing&mdash;till&mdash;till next week," I
replied, coyly.
</p>

<p>
'"Lisette," said he, "were you ever at
the village of Elewyt, where the old château
of Rubens stands, between Malines and
Vilvorde?  It is a lovely place, and wild as
lovely; not a soul would see us there.
Come with me, darling, and let us spend
one happy day together."
</p>

<p>
'"I dare not&mdash;I dare not," as a vision
of Madame Hoboken, grim, prim, and full
of proprieties, oppressed me, though I was
secretly overwhelmed with delight at the
suggestion of this stolen and, to me, new
kind of pleasure&mdash;a whole beautiful
summer afternoon to be spent hand in hand
with Lucien&mdash;hand in hand, as we were wont
to be when children in the Place Verte or
on the Boulevards.
</p>

<p>
'"Come with me, sweet one," he whispered,
"it will never&mdash;can never be known.
It is less than an hour by railway, and,
amid the bosky thickets and gardens of the
old château we shall seem to leave the
world behind us."
</p>

<p>
'So strong was the temptation to spend
an untrammelled afternoon with my
betrothed&mdash;he who within a week was to be
my husband&mdash;that I yielded.  I knew that
I ran a dreadful risk in being seen alone
with him, for Antwerp is one of the most
scandalous and gossipy towns in Belgium.
In this country the rules are very strict as
regards the daily intercourse of ladies and
gentlemen, in the mere matters of meeting
or conversing, as compared with you in
England, where the perfect freedom of the
innocent is so great; and hence, I doubt
not, your happier marriages; for in Belgium,
as in France, we are forced to espouse those
to whose inner lives we are strangers, and
to whose hearts, before marriage, we can
have no key, if it is ever found at all.
</p>

<p>
'A voiture took us to the train, and we
took seats in separate carriages.  Already
the simple, child-like expedition had an
air of guilt, and a tremulous fear possessed
me as the train glided out of the station,
through a cutting in the fortifications at the
Rue du Rempart&mdash;the wet fosse was left
behind, and we sped through the open
country.
</p>

<p>
'Glorious was the summer day; exhaled
by heat, the silvery mist was curling up
from the rich pastures, amid which the
drowsy cattle stood knee-deep, and from
the fertile arable lands, over which the
giant sails of the windmills cast their
shadows; but my heart&mdash;now that I was
alone, though separated from Lucien by
only a carriage or two&mdash;sank lower and
lower with vague apprehension, and I
restrained my tears with difficulty.  I was
full of terrors, scruples, and fears an English
girl, circumstanced as I was, would fail to
comprehend, and after traversing miles of
dairy farms, where the summer breeze
played so sweetly on the long ripples of
verdant grass, we reached the little
roadside station, where a path diverged
to Elewyt.  I gathered courage when
Lucien Volcarts joined me, and we found
ourselves indeed alone, for we were the
only persons who quitted the train, which
steamed slowly&mdash;as all Belgian trains do&mdash;on
its way to Vilvorde, and our short but
delicious day of rambling and planning,
scheming and dreaming out our future,
hand clasped in hand, began.
</p>

<p>
'We saw the old château of Rubens, now
falling fast to decay, amid its trees, on the
land of which he was seigneur, but we did
not go near it, and contented ourselves with
wandering amid the sylvan scenery, all of
which had the charm of extreme novelty to
me.  The birds that flew overhead or sung
in the hedgerows; the thickets of beech and
oak, casting shadows over pools where the
trout rose to catch the floating fly; the
white, waxen-like lilies floating also on their
surface; a little stream pouring slowly
between gravel banks and sandstone rocks;
deep water-cuts in which the Cuyp-like
cattle stood midleg for coolness; the quaint
cottages, few and far apart; the carillons
playing in a distant spire, were all sources
of delight to me&mdash;delight all the more that
I could turn from them ever and anon to
look into the tender and loving eyes of
Lucien.
</p>

<p>
'At one of the cottages, which quite
approached the dignity of a small farm, we
got some refreshment&mdash;bread, milk, and
cheese&mdash;just as we had been wont to do
when children in charge of the same <i>bonne</i>,
and the recollection of that made us laugh
and all the more enjoy such simple fare;
and truth to tell, though so near our
marriage day, in the freedom of the hour we
felt very much as if we were happy children
again; and long we lingered in one spot, I
remember, on a grassy bank under a bower
of hawthorn, where the flies buzzed and the
bees hummed, and the village bells rang
softly out, but now it was their evening
chime.
</p>

<p>
'Evening&mdash;that suggested thoughts of
home and the necessity for returning, and
we had some miles to walk to the
railway-station at Elewyt.
</p>

<p>
'"It is only five, dearest Lisette," urged
Lucien, looking at his watch; "and the
train, which deposits us at Antwerp, is not
due for an hour yet.  In a little time we
shall go, <i>petite</i>."
</p>

<p>
'The die was cast, for a day of pleasure
but marred by secret fears.  I was content
to remain a little longer, and then we set
out for the station.  More than once did
my apprehensive heart, full of undefined
forebodings, suggest the sound of a coming
train upon the air, and once, perhaps, it
was real, for, on reaching the hamlet of
Elewyt, we found the station-gate shut and
the platform untenanted.
</p>

<p>
'Lucien looked at his watch and grew
pale.  The hands still stood at five o'clock&mdash;it
was now past seven, the hour at which
I should have been at Madame Hoboken's,
and the <i>last</i> train had gone some minutes
before.
</p>

<p>
'"Gone!" replied Lucien, in a bewildered
tone, to his informant; "and the
next?"
</p>

<p>
"'Not till seven to-morrow morning&mdash;from
Brussels <i>viâ</i> Vilvorde."
</p>

<p>
'Both of us were filled with dire dismay
as we heard this.  Could a voiture, a vehicle
of any kind, be procured?  Alas! there
was not such a thing at Elewyt.
</p>

<p>
'We turned away with sickening hearts,
and I must own that mine died within me.
How was I ever to face grim and grave
Madame Hoboken?  I felt as if I had committed
a terrible crime; I shed the bitterest
tears, and I cannot tell you, here at least,
how sweetly Lucien strove to console and
soothe me.
</p>

<p>
'"I must find you shelter for the night
at yonder cottage, where we got the milk,
till train time to-morrow," said Lucien;
"for myself, I must find it where I may.
Come, <i>petite</i>, take courage; a little time, and
we shall be blessedly independent of everyone."
</p>

<p>
'On seeing Lucien's well-filled purse, the
woman at the cottage was willing enough to
accommodate us, especially on learning that
we had lost the train; but she filled me
with fresh dismay on informing me, with a
cunning and penetrating glance there was
no mistaking, that she had "but one <i>chambre
à coucher</i>, which she sometimes let to passing
English people and others who wished
to avoid strangers; and you, monsieur&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh!  I will sleep in the stable, or
anywhere, madame, provided you can accommodate
<i>mademoiselle ma sœur</i>," interrupted
Lucien, colouring at the necessary falsehood
which he told for the first time in all his
blameless life, but it was one to protect me.
</p>

<p>
'Whether the landlady believed him or
not I cannot say; but there was a strange
and saucy twinkle in her eyes, and while in
attendance upon us she provoked me by an
air of discretion she adopted; from past
experience apparently she was far too
discreet to make sudden irruptions on our
<i>tête-à-tête</i> evening, however innocent it was,
in outward seeming as she no doubt thought,
and Lucien twisted his dark moustache
angrily, as he muttered,
</p>

<p>
'"<i>Sapristi!</i> this hag does not live
mid-way between Brussels and Antwerp for
nothing."
</p>

<p>
'"Darkness must be closing over Antwerp
now, and all the lamps in the Avenue
du Commerce will be lighted throughout
its spacious length and breadth," was then
my thought; "what would Madame
Hoboken be thinking and saying of my
non-appearance?  Had Monsieur Hoboken
returned by train from Flushing?  Doubtless
he had.  Where would they be anxiously
and angrily suspecting I was?"  If they
supposed me to be remaining&mdash;as I had
more than once done if a night proved
wet&mdash;when visiting here at the Beguinage all
would be well; but the morning might ere
long produce untoward revelations, and I
wept as if my heart would break when once
again I was left alone, as my poor Lucien
betook him to sleep in a loft above the
stables, deploring the <i>malheur</i> in which he
had involved us both; but he had no one
to scold him save his colonel if he missed a
parade, while my life and whole future
might be made a burden to me.
</p>

<p>
'Anyway, I was, from a Belgian point of
view especially, in a dreadfully false position.
'There could have been no mistake as to
the hour of the fatal train, though all public
clocks in Belgium strike the hour half an
hour beforehand, thus at half-past eleven
the clock announced twelve; and luckily
for me Lucien was in plain clothes, not <i>en
grande tenue</i> as he usually was, with sword
and epaulettes on; consequently he would
be less remarked, and fortunately the rain
fell heavily that night, which might
account for my remaining for shelter at the
Beguinage.
</p>

<p>
'When morning came my spirits rose a
little, and I was up betimes to meet the
early train.  How lovely looked the
opening summer day.  The grass in the fields,
the herbs and flowers in the gardens all
glittered in the rays of the sun, as if the
dew that moistened them had been diamonds,
and the tops of the firs seemed
edged with silver.  A golden and purple
glow filled all the eastern sky, and between
it and earth the vapours of night were
floating.  The birds were awake, and the bees
hummed and the butterflies flitted about.
</p>

<p>
'To me the country seemed new and
charming, and its continuity of horizontal
lines, each rising beyond the other to the
level horizon, where in the distance rose the
spires of Antwerp, gave a sense of vastness
and novelty.
</p>

<p>
'In different carriages Lucien and I
returned to the city.  We parted with but
a glance at the station, and with a palpitating
heart I sought my temporary home in the
Avenue du Commerce&mdash;my mind a prey to
dire misgivings, full of the stolen summer
day at Elewyt, the lost train, the cottage
amid the pastures, and Madame Hoboken
to be confronted!
</p>

<p>
'My innocent secret made a very coward
of me.  Never had I told a falsehood, and
I felt as if I would rather die than tell one
now.  I had done nothing to be ashamed of,
and yet the inferences were terrible, especially
in society constituted as it is in Belgium.
</p>

<p>
'"You were, of course, at the Beguinage?"
said madame, interrogatively, as she came in
from early mass.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes; I went there in the forenoon," I
replied, with a sinking heart, though such
was precisely the case.
</p>

<p>
'"And doubtless the rain detained you
all night?"
</p>

<p>
'"The rain," said I, assentingly.
</p>

<p>
'"Yet it did not begin to fall till after
you should have been at home."
</p>

<p>
'I hurried to my own room to avoid further
questioning, happy in the conviction
that in six days now I should be the wife
of Lucien, and a free woman.
</p>

<p>
'Let me hasten over all that followed.
</p>

<p>
'How my brother Victor&mdash;cold, proud,
and stern&mdash;discovered our escapade I never
exactly knew, nor ever shall know probably
till that day when all things shall be revealed,
but he became, fatally for us, aware of
it all.
</p>

<p>
'"You were not at the Beguinage on the
night you said you were?" said he, in a low
concentrated voice, two days after, while
grasping my wrist like a vice, and eyeing me
with eyes that sparkled with fury.
</p>

<p>
'"How do you dare to say so?" I
exclaimed, but in a low and agitated voice.
</p>

<p>
'"Sapristi!" said he.  "You shall learn
in time."
</p>

<p>
'My heart died within me, for there was
the blackness of a thundercloud in Victor's
face as he flung me from him, and matters
progressed quickly after that.  I was
confined to my own room, but Madame
Hoboken informed me that several officers came
to and fro after Lucien&mdash;that there were
long and grave conferences&mdash;that Lucien
seemed terribly disturbed, and she feared
there was to be a duel on the subject, and a
duel there was, but not with swords or
pistols.  Oh, mon Dieu!  In the agony of
my heart I am anticipating.
</p>

<p>
'I grew nearly mad with terror till my
marriage morning came, and I found that no
catastrophe had taken place, for Victor came
to conduct me to church, and I wept tears
of thankfulness, joy, and gratitude, as one
who had escaped the shipwreck of a whole
life (through no fault of my own), when I
was united by Père Leopold to Lucien in
the Church of St. André&mdash;the church in
which we had both been baptised, where we
had made our first communion together&mdash;that
church with its wonderfully carved pulpit,
representing Andrew and Peter called
from their nets and boats by the Saviour, all
as large as life; and the altar of St Anthony,
with his little pig; and the black devil, with
a long, red tongue, that used to frighten me
in childhood.
</p>

<p>
'The moment the ceremony was over
Victor quitted the church without a word,
and I never saw him again.  He never
visited or came near us, but remained sullenly
aloof, as the months of the first, and
alas, last, year of our married life&mdash;my year
of joy&mdash;rolled swiftly on.  His mood would
change, I hoped, in time.  Meanwhile, Lucien,
my husband, was all the world to me;
and how proud and pleased I used to be to
see our names united, Volcarts-Gabion, as is
the custom in Antwerp.
</p>

<p>
'Looking back to that time I fear that, in
our excessive love for each other, Lucien
and I were a little selfish.  We seemed to
have so much to do in our new home&mdash;a
pleasant house in the Avenue Van Dyck,
overlooking the wooded mounds and beautiful
lakes of the park&mdash;we had ever so much
to say to each other, that we seemed to have
no leisure for making friends, or even
acquaintances, and we forgot to return, or did
so grudgingly, the visits of our hospitable
neighbours.
</p>

<p>
'If I am to speak from personal experience
no woman was ever more superlatively
happy than I, or more blessed in her
husband, and every hour that Lucien could
spare from his military duties at the Caserne
de Predicateurs was devoted me; and so my
year of joy stole swiftly away, and the first
anniversary of our marriage drew near.
</p>

<p>
'At last I became painfully conscious of
a new and unusual gloom, restlessness, and
depression of manner in Lucien, even when
he was caressing me, which he began to do
more tenderly and frequently than ever.
There was something unfathomable in the
expression of his eyes, and unaccountable in
the sadness of his voice, and in vain I pressed
him to tell me what grieved him.
</p>

<p>
'"Every human heart has some secret
which it longs to keep hidden from all,"
said he one day at last.
</p>

<p>
'"But you, dearest Lucien, should have
none from me," I urged, with my face on
his breast, which was heaving painfully
under my cheek.
</p>

<p>
'"That to which I refer you will learn
in time&mdash;most terribly&mdash;my darling Lisette,"
said he.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, why not now?" I urged; "how
cruel this is of you, Lucien!"
</p>

<p>
'"In old tales," said he, kissing away my
tears, "you have read of persons who sold
themselves to the devil?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes," said I, breathless with wonder
and apprehension at his manner.
</p>

<p>
'"And whose time on earth was hence allotted?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes."
</p>

<p>
'"Do you think that after such a bond
was signed&mdash;perhaps in blood&mdash;life would
be pleasant?"
</p>

<p>
'"No, Lucien; but what <i>do</i> you mean?"
</p>

<p>
'"That I seem to have so sold myself,"
he replied, wildly, with his eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, explain&mdash;what do you&mdash;what can
you mean?" I asked him, imploringly, as a
dreadful fear came over me that his brain
was affected.
</p>

<p>
'"I have sold myself to an evil spirit,
and now come remorse and misery&mdash;remorse
for what you will suffer, misery for my own
future."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, Lucien&mdash;my husband!" I exclaimed,
folding him in my arms, a what do these
dreadful words mean?"
</p>

<p>
'"I have so sold myself in a manner,
Lisette," said he, passionately, "and I shall
have to pay the bitter, bitter penalty in
losing you and life, and even more, perhaps,
and all for what is called honour."
</p>

<p>
'"What awful riddle is this?" I moaned.
</p>

<p>
'His words seemed to me like some dead
language, the import of which I failed to
understand.
</p>

<p>
'"Do not, oh, Lisette, when the fatal
time comes, deem me a madman," said he,
covering my face with kisses&mdash;yea, and tears
too.
</p>

<p>
'"What end&mdash;oh, what can all this
mean?" I cried, repressing with difficulty a
desire to shriek aloud, while holding him in
my embrace, for he seemed almost to faint;
his lips were a violet tint, and his face was
deathly pale.
</p>

<p>
'"I cannot tell you all that is before me,
or what I have to do and to suffer, beyond
even what I suffer now, lest you should
loathe me, scorn me; but oh, pity me,
Lisette, pity me when all is over."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, God, he is mad!" I whispered in
my heart.
</p>

<p>
'"I dare not tell you," he resumed; "I
have an enemy who is merciless, and I have
blighted your life and my own by an act of
folly, almost baseness, over which I had no
control."
</p>

<p>
'Unutterable, indescribable was my longing,
my anxious and affectionate curiosity to
know what this secret was, but next day&mdash;on
the anniversary of our marriage&mdash;I knew all.
</p>

<p>
'By an arrangement of which all the officers
of their corps were cognizant, Lucien
and my brother, Victor Gabion, who had
challenged him, fought what was called an
American duel two days before our marriage.
Two little balls, a black and a white
one, had been placed in a hat, and each of
the two principals drew out one, with the
understanding "that he who drew the black
one must be numbered with the dead within
twelve months."
</p>

<p>
'The year&mdash;my year of joy&mdash;had expired,
and in the evening Lucien shot himself!
Two days before, he had written a touching
letter to Victor, praying him for my sake
to release him from the penalty he had
incurred, but the letter miscarried, it was
never delivered, and no answer came.
</p>

<p>
'Lucien had died on the instant, and he
was found with my bracelet clasped upon
his arm.  It is buried with him, and my
heart is buried too,' added the Beguine,
sweetly and simply.
</p>

<p>
Hence it was, doubtless, that Captain
Victor Gabion had such a horror of duels,
as he told Bevil Goring, and that the
memory of one haunted him; and hence it
was also that Sister Lisette, after being a
Red Cross nurse in the war, finally entered
the Beguinage, that she might the better
dedicate herself to the service of God and
to prayer for the dead.
</p>

<p>
Alison Cheyne had endured many bitternesses,
humiliations, and mortifications during
her short experience of life; but, save
the loss of her mother and brothers, no such
keen and unmerited misery as her poor
Belgian namesake, whose strange story
gave her some food for reflection, when the
world of waters rolled between them.
</p>

<p>
The sojourn of Alison in the Beguinage
of the Rue Rouge was an epoch in the
history of that ancient institution, an era
in the peacefully monotonous and uneventful
lives of the Sisterhood.
</p>

<p>
Before this sudden illness fell upon her,
Alison's health had been at a very low ebb,
'down many pegs too low,' as her father
had said.  She had lived in a series of
excitements, joys, and sorrows of a feverish
nature, the joy of meetings with Bevil,
the sorrows of their separation; fears for
her father's health, his debts and duns; she
had to exert herself all day, yet lay all
night awake; then came the rough voyage
and the catastrophe which formed a part of
it.  Her delicate frame was being worn
out, without the necessary supports of
proper rest or proper food, and yet latterly
she had been an inmate of one of the
largest and most magnificent hotels in
Antwerp.
</p>

<p>
But she had great vitality about her, and
now recovered fast.
</p>

<p>
'We must meet again&mdash;we shall meet
again!' exclaimed Alison, as she kissed her
namesake many times while bidding her
adieu.
</p>

<p>
'How are we ever to meet,' said the Sister,
smiling, 'unless you come to the Beguinage,
as I never leave it?'
</p>

<p>
'Time will show,' said Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied the other, 'time and God
will show.'
</p>

<p>
Alison remembered these apparently
prophetic words after she was at home, and
Antwerp was far away, and her visit there
seemed but as a dream; for three days after
saw her and Sir Ranald in England.
'Ours is a nation of travellers,' says a
writer, 'and no wonder, when the elements,
air, water, fire, attend our bidding to
transport us from shore to shore; when the ship
rushes into the deep, her track the foam as
of some mighty torrent, and in three hours
or less we stand gazing or gazed at among
a foreign people.  None want an excuse.
If rich they go to enjoy; if poor to retrench;
if sick to recover; if studious to learn; if
learned to relax from their studies.'
</p>

<p>
None of these objects had brought Alison&mdash;the
creature of circumstances, and of the
plans formed by others&mdash;to Antwerp, and
now that she was home again&mdash;or once
again on British soil&mdash;the reader may
imagine how anxiously she longed for some
tidings of Bevil Goring (all unwitting that
he had been so long near her, in the land
of the stranger), whether he had gone to
face the perils of war on the Gold Coast,
or been detached at home; and the only
one who could have speedily enlightened
her thereon was the person to whom she
dared not utter his name&mdash;Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
So poor Alison could but sigh and think
with L.E.L. that
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
IN HAMPSHIRE AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
'I wish Jerry were here to help me,'
sighed Lady Julia, as she lounged in
a luxurious fauteuil in the beautiful
drawing-room of Wilmothurst, with 'Cousin'
Emily, on a dull afternoon of February,
when the trees in the stately chase were
dripping with moisture, and the reedy fens
and lonesome marshes, where the bittern
boomed and the heron waded, looked
dreary, and the edges of the water-flags
were stiff and white with frost.  'I would
Jerry were here to help me with his advice.
Not that his advice would help us much
perhaps, Emily,' she added, querulously.
</p>

<p>
'Advice, Aunt Julia?  When poor dear
Jerry was here, he did nothing,' replied that
young lady.
</p>

<p>
'And that was all he ever cared to do,
Emily; but I have seen so little of Jerry
since he joined the Rifles that I seem to be
quite alone in the world.'
</p>

<p>
And she sighed a little conventional sigh,
while spreading her feather fan, though a
large crystal screen was placed between her
and the brilliant fire that burned in a grate
of steel polished like silver.
</p>

<p>
'But matters have come to a crisis with
us; through me, I fear,' she added.
</p>

<p>
'Through you, aunt?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, unfortunately.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;in what way?'
</p>

<p>
'Did you not see how I turned my back
upon that minx, Miss Chevenix, at the
Charity Bazaar last week; cut her dead
indeed, and this is the result!' exclaimed
Lady Julia, tossing from her contemptuously
a letter she had recently received.
</p>

<p>
'What result?' asked Emily Wilmot, too
languid to open the missive in question.
</p>

<p>
'Her father will wait for the interest on
the mortgages no longer, and we are ruined!
Even this house of Wilmothurst may have to
pass to him, and we shall have to go&mdash;to go&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Where, aunt?' asked Emily, becoming
roused now, her light blue eyes dilated with
wonder, and her nose seeming more <i>retroussé</i>
than ever.
</p>

<p>
'God alone knows where; to some obscure
watering-place probably.  If this
insolent fellow, who certainly has not been
paid for some years, would only wait till
Jerry returns from the Gold Coast, and
some arrangements could be made,' continued
Lady Julia, in her plaintive and bleating
kind of voice.  'House, lands, and all
will go to Chevenix, and only a few acres
will be left us.  We are beggars,' she
continued, with angry querulousness, but
without altering a line of her smooth, handsome,
and passionless face.  'We have nothing of
our own&mdash;all will become his.'
</p>

<p>
'But surely, aunt, you have friends.
There is Lord Twiseldown&mdash;there is Sir
Jasper Dehorsey.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot stoop to ask, and who would
lend me thousands&mdash;not even money-lenders
now, for there is nothing left in the shape
of land to borrow on.  Wilmothurst will
become the property of this upstart farmer's
son out and out.  Jerry will have to give
up everything but his commission, and go to
India no doubt.  Fortunately he has that
resource left him; but I&mdash;I shall no longer
be able to maintain even you, Emily.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Wilmot's emotions of annoyance
and anger at Mr. Chevenix and the whole
situation took the form of making her niece
smart, while in reality she had no very
genuine fear of such an awful crisis coming
about, thinking that heaven or fate, or
something or other, would never permit a
person of her position to be so heavily visited.
</p>

<p>
'And <i>what</i> shall I do, auntie?' asked the
young lady, plaintively, but with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'You may have to go out into the world
as a governess or companion.'
</p>

<p>
'Governess or companion! while Bella
Chevenix&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Will reign here as heiress of Wilmothurst,'
said Lady Julia, with the first
approach to expression on her lineless
face&mdash;a bitter and scornful smile.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, it is hard&mdash;very hard!'
</p>

<p>
'Very hard for <i>me</i>,' added Lady Julia,
who like most of her class thought chiefly
of 'number one.'
</p>

<p>
'She will make some good marriage,'
said Emily, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'She is decidedly very handsome, and
has, my maid Florine tells me, magnificent
hair.'
</p>

<p>
'Handsome,' queried the fair Emily;
'yes, but aunt, this is an age of belladonna,
pearl powder, rouge, and heaven knows
what more.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope the Gold Coast will have cured
Jerry of his foolish fancy for that artful girl.'
</p>

<p>
'Her tastes are decidedly rural.  I have
been told that she often assists the vicar in
visiting the poor, and actually teaches in
his school at times.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, she is more in her place there,
and acting the village Samaritan, than riding
with the buckhounds, dancing at county and
garrison balls, and giving herself the airs of
the <i>habituée du monde</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Julia had in her arms a Maltese
spaniel, a wheezy, fat, and petted cur that
often reposed in a mother-of-pearl basket
lined with blue satin, and she was fondling
it as she had never fondled Jerry when an
infant&mdash;a cur that snapped viciously at
every one who approached within ten yards
of it or her, but which she always
apostrophised and talked to as if it had been a
human being; and, sooth to say, it was
about as human in feeling as this earl's
daughter, so far as tenderness and a capacity
for loving went&mdash;loving any one at least but
herself.
</p>

<p>
'Come, my sweet one, Floss,' she now
exclaimed, oblivious suddenly of her
approaching woes, and while it was leaping
and yapping on her knee she kissed it
repeatedly, and said, in a cooing voice,
'Did it want to go for a drive on this cold
cold February afternoon?  Then its
mamma will order the carriage and take it
for one.'
</p>

<p>
If Jerry had never in his tender boyhood
been fondled in this manner, how often had
he felt in after-life that much of the
attention his mother <i>did</i> at any time bestow
upon him was due less to any maternal
instinct or love than to his position and
means as Squire of Wilmothurst and to
family pride and vanity.
</p>

<p>
'A letter, my lady,' said a tall footman,
presenting one on a salver, and withdrawing
noiselessly.
</p>

<p>
'Another from this man Chevenix
already.  Again! really, really, what can
this person want now!'
</p>

<p>
She tore it impatiently open, the diamonds
on her white fingers sparkling as she
did so, and her delicately pencilled
eyebrows were elevated as she read with
aristocratic surprise and impatience:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"With reference to my letter of this
morning about the mortgages, dear Lady
Julia, take all the delay you may wish.
They shall not be foreclosed till time has
soothed the awful blow that has fallen upon
you."'
</p>

<p>
'Blow!' exclaimed Lady Julia.  'What
blow?&mdash;what can the man mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Read on, auntie&mdash;there is something more.'
</p>

<p>
'"The fall of your son so gallantly in
Western Africa is a circumstance to be
deplored indeed by all&mdash;but more than all
by those who knew him."
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens&mdash;good heavens&mdash;good
heavens!' said Lady Julia thrice, in a low
yet fretful voice, as if she scarcely understood
the situation; 'it is all some dreadful
mistake; Jerry&mdash;Jerry&mdash;a mistake, Emily.
I saw nothing of it in the <i>Post</i> or <i>Times</i> this
morning.
</p>

<p>
She was trembling excessively now, and
Emily's eyes were full of hot welling tears.
Neither of the ladies had seen the fatal
intelligence from the seat of war, for, as they
all read only the fashionable intelligence,
they had heeded transactions on the Gold
Coast as much they did those that may be
occurring in the mountains of the moon.
</p>

<p>
However, to do them justice, both were
thunderstruck&mdash;impressed as much as it was
in their frozen nature to be&mdash;when Emily,
after rushing for the morning paper, found
the brief telegram or paragraph to which,
no doubt, Mr. Chevenix referred:
</p>

<p>
'<i>Coomassie in flames.  Army falling back
on the Gold Coast; but the rivers rising fast.
Chief casualties&mdash;Captain Dalton, Rifles,
severely wounded; Captain J. Wilmot, do.,
killed and carried off by the enemy.</i>'
</p>

<p>
The fashionable aunt and niece, at whose
pleasant doors grief and sorrow seldom or
never came, sat for a time as if stunned.
Chevenix and his mortgages were alike
forgotten; they could but think of Jerry and
strive to realize the&mdash;to them&mdash;almost impossible
situation, while the dull and depressing
afternoon stole on.
</p>

<p>
How could it be, or why was it, that
Jerry, so jolly and manly&mdash;the son of such
a cold and feeble-minded woman of rank
and fashion, who had done her best, but
failed, to spoil or pamper him&mdash;was reserved
for such a fate as this!
</p>

<p>
He had escaped the battle of Amoaful,
the passage of the Prah, the fighting prior
to the capture of Coomassie, and all the
perils of death by fever and toil to perish
thus, when the wretched end had been
achieved and the troops must have been on
their homeward way.
</p>

<p>
Poor Jerry!  The life of the mess and the
life of Wilmothurst when at home, where, in
consideration of his five feet ten inches and
irreproachable moustache, he had been
latterly permitted to be termed a 'son,' and
not, as his mother would have wished, a 'boy.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Julia Wilmot had never posed in
society save as a beauty, and the great
consideration that was ever shown her was
due to that beauty and her birth and
position as an earl's daughter; but not to
any brilliant qualities of head&mdash;still less of
amiability of heart.  Thus in many ways
she was a fair average example of 'the
upper ten.'
</p>

<p>
So now it may be said of her and Cousin
Emily on this disastrous occasion,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Some natural tears they shed, but wip'd them soon.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And their first thoughts were of a suitable
and handsome tablet to Jerry's memory in
the Vicarage Church, and of fashionable
mourning for themselves and the household.
It would all cast a gloom over their return
to town after Easter in March, when a
'brief season' would commence&mdash;if they
went to town at all, for 'thank Heaven,'
added Lady Julia, 'no one shall accuse me
of not doing my duty to my son.  I shall
order my mourning at Jay's, and certainly
will not wear one of those frightful bonnets
with long&mdash;what is it now, John?'
</p>

<p>
A tall footman, with a face of woe made
up for the occasion, and a manner adapted
to it&mdash;for the news had spread like wildfire
over all the house and vicinity, and when
many genuine tears were shed in the
servants' hall, where Jerry was a prime
favourite with the women folks&mdash;brought in
a card, announcing
</p>

<p>
'Miss Chevenix.'
</p>

<p>
'Chevenix again&mdash;this is intolerable!
Did you say not at home?'
</p>

<p>
'I said you were engaged&mdash;severially
indispoged, my lady,' he replied, shaking his
cauliflower-looking head solemnly.
</p>

<p>
'Yet&mdash;she would come in.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my lady.'
</p>

<p>
'And at a time like this&mdash;when we are
plunged in unutterable woe!  Such
confident assurance!'
</p>

<p>
The door was thrown open, and Bella
Chevenix came swiftly forward as the
servant withdrew.
</p>

<p>
But in this we are anticipating a little.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
'THOUGHTS THAT OFTEN LIE TOO DEEP FOR TEARS.'
</h3>

<p>
Like the again partially widowed Laura,
Bella Chevenix had watched with an
aching heart the progressive news of the
war among barbarians on the burning Gold
Coast, from the landing on New Year's Day
to the battle of Amoaful, the passage of the
Prah, and the victorious advance on
Coomassie; and now came the sudden shock
and horror by a tantalisingly brief telegram,
in the upper corner of a newspaper, headed
by a sensational title in large type, but
three lines, announcing that the two officers
had fallen&mdash;Dalton severely wounded, and
Wilmot killed and carried off by the enemy!
</p>

<p>
Bella sat for a time as one turned to
stone, incapable even of tears&mdash;oppressed
and crushed down by the one appalling and
apparently, unrealisable thought.
</p>

<p>
'Jerry dead&mdash;Jerry dead&mdash;and I shall
never see him more!'
</p>

<p>
Jerry, so full of life and fun and jollity!
It seemed incredible.  And yet, why so?
He only ran the risks that many others
were running.  But the mind of Bella went
painfully back to their parting, when mutual
doubts of the purity and honesty of each
other's intentions&mdash;doubts born of the
existence of those horrible mortgages&mdash;had
mutually fettered their tongues, especially
so far as she was concerned, and, when they
separated, little dreaming that it was for
ever&mdash;separated with a simply repeated
'good-bye' and a lingering pressure of the
hand, while no kiss, no embrace, no promise
were exchanged, and he was going away to
be done to death in that savage land; and
she remembered how she wept floods of
unavailing tears as the last sound of his
footsteps died away.  Poor fellow!  And now
she should see him no more&mdash;never again!
</p>

<p>
To Bella Chevenix sorrow, repentance,
and love were alike useless, so far as Jerry
Wilmot was concerned.  To the girl, just
then, it seemed as if the dream of her life
was over and done; in it no other could
replace Jerry; the light had gone for ever
out of her world now.  She threw herself
upon her knees, in the solitude of her chamber,
in a passionate burst of grief&mdash;the brilliant,
beautiful, and once happy Bella&mdash;and
strove to say, 'Thy will be done,' but the
genuine submission thereto could only come
by-and-by.
</p>

<p>
Under the circumstances of Jerry's
profession and career, some peril, some
suffering were not altogether unlooked-for or
undreaded; but that he should be killed
and carried off by the dreadful Ashantees,
of whom she had a very vague yet terrible
idea indeed, had been beyond her
calculations&mdash;beyond her worst anticipations!  She
felt dazed, miserable&mdash;intensely, and confused.
</p>

<p>
'I am now sure that he loved me well&mdash;well
and dearly&mdash;and how coldly I parted
with him!  Oh, Jerry my darling, can it be
that I shall never see you again!'  Thus she
said to herself over and over in sad
reiteration, though no sound but sighs left her
lips.
</p>

<p>
Anon she rose and paced her room, with
half uttered exclamations of anguish and
sorrow; and then she would throw herself
on her bed, burying her face in her hands,
in mute and tearless agony.  To think that
he was gone&mdash;in his grave, if he ever found
one&mdash;gone without the memory of a kind
word from her that would make her future
life less bitter.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Jerry&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!' she murmured,
with ceaseless reiteration.
</p>

<p>
She had a craving for such sympathy as
her father, who was to a great extent
ignorant of all that had passed between her and
Jerry, could not yield her, and she resolved
to visit Laura.
</p>

<p>
She staggered from the bedside to her
toilette-table, and when she looked into the
glass she was surprised by the frozen-like
despair she saw in her own beautiful face,
which was as colourless as Carrara marble
now.  She bathed her eyes, made a hasty
toilette of the most sable things she could
select, tied a thick black veil over her face,
and, ordering her pony phaeton, set out to
visit Laura, to whom the dire tidings had
come, of course, betimes, and she too was
overwhelmed by affliction that, however,
was not without hope.
</p>

<p>
She was alone now, most terribly alone
at Chilcote Grange.  Little Netty had been
sent to a West End finishing school that
she might acquire all sorts of accomplishments
and graces with which to delight
her father on his return; and now perhaps
poor Tony Dalton might die by the banks
of the Prah and never see England again,
for the heat of the horrible climate there
made all wounds more perilous.
</p>

<p>
'Wounded, severely wounded,' Laura
had been repeating to herself: but where
wounded, she speculated&mdash;how, and with
what, and in what part of the poor mortal
frame.
</p>

<p>
The telegram was horribly brief and
vague!  And now though Laura and Bella
Chevenix had few notes to compare, and
could say nothing to comfort each other,
they gathered some from the communion of
tears and thoughts and sorrows.
</p>

<p>
Laura drew forth&mdash;as she had done a
score of times before&mdash;Dalton's letters to
her from Madeira, the Gold Coast, and sent
by more than one homeward-bound ship;
and the affection they breathed for her and
Netty filled her soul with great gratitude
now, whatever might happen.  She had
never received letters from him before&mdash;even
in their early lover days at St. Leonard's
long ago, before their years of
separation came: and how strange it was to
have received letters from him, conceived in
the tenor of these, and signed 'Your
affectionate husband, Tony Dalton.'
</p>

<p>
Now he and Laura were quite old enough
to know their own minds, and to deplore
the separation a previous less knowledge of
each other had brought about between
them; neither was likely to make any more
false steps, from rashness or impulse, and
they had a fair promise of a delicious
companionship for the future if they were
spared to meet again, and the perils of the
Gold Coast ever became a thing of the
past, but that fair promise hung by a thread
now.
</p>

<p>
'Had we never met more&mdash;met as we
did so singularly by the sudden arrival of
his regiment in Aldershot,' said Laura, 'and
I loved or compelled him, poor darling, to
love me again, I might have gone on to the
end of my days nursing a sickly sentimental
memory on one hand, with a species of
revengeful memory on the other; but, if
we never meet more on this side of the
grave, I shall&mdash;till carried to mine&mdash;remember
with gratitude that he had learned to
love me well, and Netty too, before we lost
him for ever.'
</p>

<p>
All her natural gaiety and much of her
aplomb had left Laura on the day Dalton
sailed from Southampton, and now she was
as crushed in spirit as a poor woman well
could be.  'We love because we have loved,'
says a novelist, 'and it is easier to go on in
the old routine, even when all the real life
and beauty has died out of it, than to break
with the mere <i>memory</i> of that time which
made our life holy and beautiful to us.'
</p>

<p>
In the time of this strange enforced
separation&mdash;in the time of Dalton's actual
desertion of Laura, and when she knew not
whether he was dead or living till she met
him at Aldershot&mdash;this had been something
of the sentiment that inspired her; but now
that they had both known and loved each
other anew under better auspices, and been
so briefly re-united, a contemplation of the
catastrophe that might yet happen wrung
Laura's heart to the core.
</p>

<p>
On leaving the latter, Bella, though still
a prey to choking grief, in the warm and
generous impulse of her nature, conceived
the idea of, or thought she might find some
comfort in, a visit to Lady Wilmot.  She
was <i>his</i> mother, whose grief at least could
not be inferior to her own.
</p>

<p>
She committed to oblivion all that lady's
treatment of herself in the past time, and
even but lately at the Charity Bazaar; yet
it was not without some misgivings, and
even pausing in her progress once or twice,
that she turned the heads of her pretty
ponies in the direction of Wilmothurst, her
tears falling hotly under her thick Shetland
veil as she passed down the stately avenue
and through the Chase, where every foot of
the way suggested some memory of Jerry
and his happy boyhood, when they were
playmates till he went to Eton, and Lady
Julia&mdash;well, never permitted <i>her</i> name to
be on the ordinary visitors' list.  There was
a tall elm up which he had clambered, at
the risk of his limbs, to get her a magpie's
nest; here they had gathered the early
primroses in April, and the Lent lilies in
May, or hunted for butterflies.  How often
had they played croquet together on the
bowling-green, and rowed dreamily for
hours on the tree-shaded river; and at
every turn the figure of the boy seemed to
come before her, mingled with that of the
moustached and handsome young officer to
whom she so strangely bade farewell.
</p>

<p>
Full of these thoughts, Bella would not
be repelled by the conventional manner or
replies of the footman, and begged so earnestly
to see Lady Julia that she was ushered
into her presence by the former, as we have
described in the last chapter.
</p>

<p>
Poor Bella had but one thought&mdash;Lady
Julia was <i>his</i> mother, and gladly in that
hour of woe would she have thrown her
arms around her and embraced her tenderly;
but Lady Julia was cold and calm in
aspect and bearing as a Greek marble statue,
and received her visitor without rising, and
with a brief conventional pressure with one
hand while motioning her to be seated with
the other.
</p>

<p>
Whatever hopes Cousin Emily once had
of Jerry for a husband&mdash;hopes often crushed
by his indifference on the subject, and by a
knowledge of the necessity that he must
marry 'money'&mdash;they were gone now; and,
besides, she could receive Bella Chevenix
now with more equanimity than hitherto.
</p>

<p>
But her reception was common-place&mdash;chilling
also&mdash;and poor Bella, feeling herself
<i>de trop</i>, an utter intruder, felt confusion
blend with the grief that oppressed her.
</p>

<p>
'After the awful news of this morning,
Lady Julia,' said she, with a great effort,
'as an old friend of the family, whose
ancestors have been for years upon the estate,
as a neighbour, too, in a lonely part of the
county&mdash;more than all&mdash;all&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;I
conceived a great craving to see you,' said the
girl, brokenly, in a weak, yet exquisitely
sweet voice.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed&mdash;thanks.'
</p>

<p>
This was not an encouraging response,
nevertheless Bella spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'Jerry&mdash;Wilmot, I mean&mdash;and I were
such playmates in our childhood long, long
ago, that&mdash;that&mdash;you know&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Bella's voice completely failed her under
the cold, inquiring eyes of Lady Julia and
Emily Wilmot.
</p>

<p>
'Playmates!' said the former.  'Yes, your
memory does you credit.  I thought you
must have forgotten all that by this time, as
I am sure my poor dear boy did.'
</p>

<p>
'Forgotten!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I think I heard him say something
like that to his friend, Captain Goring.'
</p>

<p>
'If he spoke of those pleasant times, he
would scarcely have forgotten them,' was
the natural response of Bella, to whom Lady
Julia, after a languid stare, said,
</p>

<p>
'Next mail must bring some distinct details
of this calamity that has fallen upon
me and Miss Wilmot.'
</p>

<p>
Bella felt that she was excluded from the
co-partnery of grief&mdash;she who loved the
dead as she loved her own soul, and more,
and she was almost, in spite of herself,
tempted to daringly enter some little
protest when Lady Julia spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'I wish Captain Goring were at home; I
should send for him.  By the way, does not
rumour say he has succeeded to a fortune?'
</p>

<p>
'To £20,000 a year,' replied Bella, in a
low voice.
</p>

<p>
'Say £10,000&mdash;that will be nearer the
mark, perhaps £5,000.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'I believe very little that I see, and always
but the half of what I hear,' she replied,
fanning herself.
</p>

<p>
'How can this woman think of such matters
just <i>now</i>,' thought Bella, an emotion of
resentful bitterness growing in her heart.
'Oh, how little did she deserve to have such
a son as my darling Jerry!'
</p>

<p>
The snapping and snarling of Floss, who
always resented the advent of visitors, now
required all Lady Julia's kisses and blandishments
to soothe him into the recess of his
mother-of-pearl basket; and to Bella it
seemed monstrous, incredible, her bearing.  Only
this morning these women heard of the dire
calamity, and they were to all appearance
as 'cool as cucumbers'&mdash;a little redness they
exhibited about the eyes certainly, and a
certain subdued manner alone seemed to
show that they had in any way laid to heart
the death of the poor fellow whose obsequies
might have been performed by the birds of
the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless Bella failed to understand the
highly born and long descended; yet in
many a gallant field, against both Scots and
French, long before even the days of the
great Civil War, had her ancestors done
good and true yeoman service, with bow and
bill, for their acres at Langley Park, under
the banner of the Wilmots, with its three
eagles' heads&mdash;<i>sable</i> and <i>argent</i>.
</p>

<p>
At last she rose.
</p>

<p>
'It is well for you, Lady Julia,' said she,
'that you are able to take this awful
dispensation of Providence so calmly as you do.'
</p>

<p>
'When a thing is inevitable or irreparable,
it is best to bow the head and accept it with
a good grace,' replied the bereaved mother,
closing her fan, but not rising from the
fauteuil on which she was reclining, looking
gentle and soft, yet iron-bound and icily
conventional.
</p>

<p>
'The loss of an only son, and such a son?'
exclaimed Bella, indignation mingling with
her grief, as she burst into a flood of
irrepressible tears, on which Lady Julia gave her
a stare of well-bred astonishment, and asked,
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, Miss Chevenix, by
this excessive emotion?  Have you lost any
relation recently that you come almost in
black, and with these jet ornaments?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;but I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;' stammered Bella.
</p>

<p>
'You thought&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'That for poor Jerry&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Do you mean Captain Wilmot&mdash;my son?'
asked Lady Julia, icily.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Bella, boldly enough now;
'we were such old and good friends that I
thought&mdash;a little change of dress was but
becoming reverence to his memory; and I
shall make it deeper still.'
</p>

<p>
'As you please,' said Lady Julia, bowing
curtly, while Cousin Emily rang the bell, and
bowed the visitor out.
</p>

<p>
The two ladies then stared at each other.
</p>

<p>
There was a <i>deduction</i> to be drawn from
honest Bella's deep, pathetic, and unconcealed
interest and grief for the poor dead fellow
that proved somewhat offensive to Lady
Julia, who, amid her own sorrow&mdash;or what
she considered such&mdash;had been considering
the fashion of her own mourning&mdash;of mourning
for the entire household&mdash;and of a handsomely
quartered hatchment to 'hang upon
the outward wall'; thus she was rather
astounded and indignant at the rash or adopted
bearing in one of Bella's rank and position;
but they savoured, she thought, somewhat
of the servants' hall in demonstrativeness.
</p>

<p>
She was ashamed as yet to consult her
<i>Dressmakers' Album</i>, even with the aid of
Emily and Mademoiselle Florine, anent the
most becoming fashion of mourning; but
to-morrow she would certainly do so.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Assurement, oui!</i>' thought Florine.
</p>

<p>
Anger and no small degree of contempt
were in the heart of Bella as she quitted the
park gates of Wilmothurst, with a kind of
dull and sodden despair mingling therein, as
she drove her ponies home in the February
twilight to her father's house that overlooked
the village green, and she thought how true
were the words of Wordsworth of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.'<br>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
'OH, FOR A HORSE WITH WINGS!'
</h3>

<p>
Jerry lay long when we left him last in
a state of semi-unconsciousness, thoughts
of his past life rather than of his present
most perilous and deplorable predicament
hovering in his mind.  He sometimes
imagined himself at the mess, and heard the
voices and saw the faces of Goring, Dalton,
Frank Fleming, and others; anon he was in
the Long Valley at Aldershot skirmishing
with his company, or riding a hurdle-race
by Twesildown Hill.  Then came dreams of
the ball at Wilmothurst and of Bella Chevenix
in all her beauty, and his cold, pale,
passionless mother.  Again he was in the
playing-fields at Eton&mdash;again chosen stroke
of the Oxford boat.  All these floated
before him with an overwhelming sense of
pain in his head, as once again he struggled
back to the world and a full sense of the
awful horror of his situation came upon him.
Thankful we may be that, as Pope has it,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Heaven from all creatures hides the book of Fate,<br>
  All but the page prescribed, their present state.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The prospect of Jerry's future made his
heart seem to die within him.
</p>

<p>
The sun was shining brightly now, and
save the loud hum of insect life no sound
was in the air or around him.  A heavy
odour of burnt wood and of moist thatch
came upon the passing wind from where the
fires of the past night were still smouldering
in Coomassie, and once more staggering
up Jerry looked around him.
</p>

<p>
He was alone&mdash;left in the bush to perish;
and his comrades, where were they?
</p>

<p>
Miles on the happy homeward march to
the coast, with the swollen rivers all
unbridged and impassable in their rear!
</p>

<p>
He saw it all&mdash;he felt it all, and knew
that he was a lost man.  Feeble, defenceless,
and single-handed he would fall a
victim to the first savage and infuriated
Ashantee he met, and his skull would soon
be laid as an ornament&mdash;a royal trophy&mdash;at
the foot of the king.
</p>

<p>
A heavy moan escaped poor Jerry; but
the love of life, the instinct of self-preservation
is strong in human nature, and his first
thought was to endeavour to follow the army.
</p>

<p>
At a pool he bathed his head and face,
washed away the plastered blood that
encrusted all the vicinity of the wound on his
head, and bound the latter up with his
handkerchief.  He luckily found his light
helmet in the hollow where he had lain
unseen by his comrades, and, after giving a
glance to the chambers of his loaded
revolver, endeavoured to follow as closely as
he could the track that led he knew towards
the army&mdash;the track the latter must have
trodden.
</p>

<p>
But he frequently lost it, vast swamps and
sheets of water were formed now where
none had been before, and he had to make
harassing detours; his powers and his steps
were feeble, thus his progress was slow and
often doubtful, and ever and anon he had
to pause and look around him, fearing that
in the dingles of the woody wilderness he
might see the dark and agile figure of a
hostile savage.
</p>

<p>
Mid-day came when he was certain that
he could have made but a very few miles of
progress, and gasping with heat, giddy and
weary, he crept under the shadow of a
dense leafy bush to rest and conceal himself.
</p>

<p>
Could he have been certain of the route,
he knew that it would have been safer to
travel by night, but in the night he must
fail to see the traces of it, and now, with
weariness and pain, a great horror of the
whole situation came upon him, and he
could but mutter again and again,
</p>

<p>
'Alone&mdash;alone in the bush&mdash;to die!  God
help me!'
</p>

<p>
Poor Jerry was a popular, light-hearted,
prosperous, and happy young fellow, whom
every one liked and to whom pleasant
things happened every day.  He was wont
to own that he found every one kind and
every one nice, and in society, of course,
he met many people.  Wherever Jerry
had gone, at school, at college, or with the
Rifles, he converted strangers into acquaintances,
and acquaintances soon became his
friends.  Wherever he went invitations to
dinners, balls, drums, lawn-tennis, and other
parties flowed upon him, for he was decidedly
a popular young fellow, with the girls
especially.
</p>

<p>
All that seemed ended!
</p>

<p>
To Jerry, accustomed as he had been to
the sunny side of life, and to float without a
thought upon its rippling and glittering
current, there was something worse than death
in his present predicament.  He could
understand being shot in action, and then
being buried in a hole or left unburied to
the fowls of the air, but this struggle against
destruction&mdash;this living death&mdash;was utterly
beyond all his calculations!
</p>

<p>
He partook sparingly of the contents of
his haversack, reflecting the while on what
must inevitably ensue when the last of that
support for exhausted nature was expended,
for he could not escape a death by starvation
even if he escaped death by other
means.
</p>

<p>
Without food, without comrades, without
help or means to cross the swollen rivers!
The perspiration burst in beads upon his
temples; his pulsation caused the aching of
his contused wound to become agony; his
muscles grew rigid, he set his teeth, and
began to surmise how long he would last&mdash;how
long he could endure all that must be
before him now, while muttering again,
</p>

<p>
'Alone in the bush to die&mdash;God help me!'
</p>

<p>
He had in his haversack rations for three
days; even if he could make them last for
seven, his resource would end then; and,
even while sheltered by the giant leaves
which abounded there, the baleful night
dews might induce fever and ague, while
the waters that barred his progress were
more likely to rise than to fall, as the rainy
season, which had made Sir Garnet Wolseley
begin his sudden retreat, had now commenced.
</p>

<p>
Tidings that he had perished would soon
be telegraphed to England; many there, he
knew, would regret him; with something of
a bitter smile he remembered the farewell
parting with his cold, aristocratic mother,
and then the thought of Bella perhaps
becoming&mdash;for she was known to be rich&mdash;the
bride of the horsey Lord Twesildown.
</p>

<p>
The thought of that nerved him to
exertion; the sun was verging westward now,
and once more, with feeble steps and slow
he took to the track again, half blinded at
times by the crimson glare of light that
poured between the stems of the trees, for
the track he had to pursue was then straight
in the wake of the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
He could form no idea of the distance he
had gone, but the odour of burned wood
which reached him from time to time
warned him that he was still unpleasantly
near Coomassie, and more than once sounds
that came upon the wind like a savage shout
and the distant beating of a war-drum, made
him creep into the jungle for concealment,
and thus lose time, when, if he would hope
to overtake the army, now many miles on
their homeward way, every moment was
most precious.
</p>

<p>
At last, when night, with tropical swiftness,
had descended he found his progress
hopelessly barred by that great sheet of
water which we have already referred to&mdash;a
reach of five hundred yards in breadth that
rolled now at a place through which in
advancing the army had passed dry-shod.
</p>

<p>
'Out of the running!' exclaimed poor
Jerry, using his home phraseology; 'oh,
heavens! how to bridge this sea that lies
between me and the troops?  Oh, for a
horse with wings!' he added, unconsciously
quoting the exclamation of Cymbeline.
</p>

<p>
When night fell no resource was left him
but to remain there and gaze with haggard
eyes and a desponding heart at the cruel
sheet of water that lay between him and
probable safety.
</p>

<p>
Brightly, as on the New Year's night that
saw the troops landing on that fatal shore,
the moon was shining now&mdash;brighter even;
never had Jerry seen such brilliancy.  In
all the vast expanse of the firmament overhead
there was not a vestige of cloud.  Millions
of stars were there, but their splendour
was dimmed or obscured by the splendid
effulgence of the moon.  The vast leaves of
plants, whose names were all unknown to
the lost Jerry, were shining in dew as if
diamonds had rained from heaven; every
giant cotton-tree and palm, every rock and
fissure were illuminated, and the birds flew
to and fro as if a new day had dawned, but
a day of silver, icy-like splendour, and clear
as in a mirror were the shadows of the
trees and graceful palms reflected downward
in the sheet of water that glittered in the
sheen.
</p>

<p>
But that he was so weary and faint Jerry
would have availed himself of this wonderful
moonlight and endeavoured to get round
the flank of the vast sheet of water that
barred his progress, and which reflected the
radiance like a mighty sheet of crystal; but
he was compelled to wait till morning, and
again sought shelter under some jungly
bushes.
</p>

<p>
Near the place he saw several broken
meat tins and empty bottles scattered about,
indicating where some of our troops had
halted before the final march was made into
Coomassie; and he regarded with interest
and anxiety these vestiges which proved that
he was in the right track could he but cross
the intervening flood.
</p>

<p>
With his very existence trembling in the
balance with fate, what a small matter now
seemed the mortgages over Wilmothurst and
every consideration save the love of Bella
Chevenix; and while he strove to court
sleep&mdash;oblivion in that savage wilderness, where
no sound met the ear save the plash of falling
dew as some overcharged leaf bent downward;
his whole soul was full of her image&mdash;the
image of her he too probably should
never, never see again.
</p>

<p>
With earliest dawn he was again afoot and
seeking to get round the reach of water, but
it trended away through hollows far to the
north and south, yet with an aching heart he
struggled manfully at his task.  On every
hand towered up to the height of two hundred
and fifty feet or more, straight as stone
columns, the cotton-trees, like the giants of
primeval vegetation, and round their bases
flourished the wondrous undergrowth of
jungle, under which again grew white lilies,
pink flowers, and dog-roses; amid which
could be heard sharp trumpetings of enormous
mosquitoes, with the monotonous too-too
of the wild doves, which alone broke
the silence of the bush.
</p>

<p>
'This silence,' wrote one who served in
the campaign, 'this apparently never-ending
forest, this monotony of rank vegetation, this
absence of a breath of wind to rustle a leaf,
becomes oppressive, and the feeling is not
lessened by the dampness and heaviness of
the air, and by the malarious exhalation and
odour of decaying vegetation which rise from
the swamps.'
</p>

<p>
The report of a musket at no great distance,
followed by the noise made by some
wounded animal crashing through the forest.
compelled Jerry, with a heart that beat
wildly with agitation and alarm, to conceal
himself instantly; and he had hardly done
so, when four armed Ashantees, with muscular
mahogany-coloured forms, gleaming eyes,
and shining teeth, passed near him and
continued to hover about, as if scouting or in
pursuit of game.
</p>

<p>
This compelled him to lie for hours <i>en
perdu</i>, and evening began to close again
without his having got round the reach of
water that lay between him and the way to
Prah, and even if he ever did reach the
banks of that stream how was he to cross
it? for he was not a swimmer.
</p>

<p>
On this night there was no moon, for the
clouds were densely massed in the heavens;
the rain fell in torrents, and though sheltered
therefrom in the hollow of a rock Jerry
listened to the crashing sound of the vast
drops falling in a ceaseless shower, with a
species of dull despair, for higher than ever
would the waters rise now; his food was
failing him, and he gave himself up for
utterly lost.
</p>

<p>
With dawn the rain departed, and the
sun exhaled a dense steamy mist from the
drenched forest; but Jerry dared not leave
his lair, for more than once in the distance
he heard distinctly cries, strange sounds,
and the explosion of firearms, showing
evidently that scouting parties of Ashantees
were hovering about, if it were not their
whole army following up ours, which must
be, he knew, at a vast distance then.
</p>

<p>
He had now come to his last biscuit, and
finding all still when night fell he again
addressed himself to the task of attempting
to ford the water at a place where
it seemed shallow.  The sky was again
cloudy, veiling most of the stars, and the
moon had not yet risen.
</p>

<p>
At that point the forest was open for a
great space, and luxuriant grass and reed-like
rushes covered all the soil.  Weak and
weary, stiff and sore, though he had lurked
in concealment all day, he staggered like a
drunken man as he approached the water,
but ere he could enter it some uncertain
sounds made him look behind.  He saw
the gleam of arms, the flash of steel in the
starlight; and then, coming upon him at a
rush, apparently were some twenty men,
emerging swiftly from the forest he had
left; and though he drew his sword and
grasped his revolver, resolved to sell his
life bitterly and dearly, so enfeebled was his
frame, and so great was the shock&mdash;the
horror&mdash;he experienced at the prospect of
the terrible death which so surely awaited
him, after all he had endured and undergone,
that he fell prone on his face and
scarcely remembered more, as they closed
in wild tumult around him.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
A BIRTHDAY GIFT.
</h3>

<p>
'Twa heads are better than ane, though
they are but sheep's anes,' remarked
Archie Auchindoir, with a smirk on his
wrinkled face, to old Mrs. Prune, as he
gave her a lesson in the art of cooking
mutton to imitate venison, with minced
onions and ham, parsley and port wine, to
please the fastidious palate of his ailing
master Sir Ranald, who dearly doted on
many things he could not procure now, and
of course longed for venison.  So these
two old servitors were again to their joy
installed with the little household once more
at Chilcote.
</p>

<p>
And most welcome again to Alison was
old silver-haired Archie, with his genuine
ancient Scottish fidelity 'to the auld family'&mdash;a
species of fidelity as beautiful and
unselfish as it is rare now-a-days.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Solomon Slagg had failed to let
Chilcote; the ruse under which Sir Ranald
and Cadbury had lured Alison to accompany
them in a sudden departure from England
in the <i>Firefly</i> had failed, so there was
no reason why they should not return; thus
Sir Ranald and his daughter had returned
accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Daisy Prune's mother had soon restocked
the hen-house, and her old occupations
came pleasantly back to Alison.  At present
she was full of one thing and another;
home was home again; her plants, her
greenhouse, her flowers occasioned many a
deep consultation with the factotum of the
establishment, old Archie, anent slips, bulbs,
and seedlings, for her love of flowers amid
all her cares and anxieties had never
deserted her.
</p>

<p>
So father and daughter were back again
to homelier fare than that of the Hôtel
St. Antoine, for their dessert after dinner, if
served upon the scanty remains of ancient
plate, often consisted of only two bald dishes
of oranges and a few little biscuits.
</p>

<p>
In her singleness and simplicity of heart,
Alison rejoiced to be again amid her familiar
surroundings, as she was destitute of her
father's spirit of futile repining and regrets
for the unattainable; thus every bit of
furniture looked an old friend, more particularly
those relics of Essilmont, the family
portraits, some of which&mdash;especially those
of two handsome cavalier brothers who
fell in battle for King Charles&mdash;seemed to
the girl's fancy to relax their haughty
features, and smile a welcome home to
her&mdash;the last of the Cheynes&mdash;as she nestled
with one of Mudie's last novels in her
favourite window-seat and strove to read, while
her thoughts wandered to Bevil Goring,
wherever he might be, and she pined for
him, but in vain.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury was in town just then.
Her father had not seen fit to enlighten her
as to the circumstance of Goring having
followed them to Antwerp, a fact which
would have enhanced his interest in the
eyes of Alison.  Of the Cadbury episode,
and the meeting which never came off at
the Lunette St. Laurent, he knew nothing;
but he was old-fashioned enough and
high-spirited enough to have revolted at such
cowardice, if he had been aware of it.
</p>

<p>
Alison speculated deeply.  If Bevil Goring
was in England, how was it that he made
no effort to trace her?  Could it be that
stung by her father's imperious manner, and
hopeless of ever being rich enough to please
him, he had relinquished her and her love,
and perhaps given himself up to the
adoration of another?  She had heard and read
of such things, and these surmises saddened
and agitated her.
</p>

<p>
Laura had left Chilcote Grange, none
knew for where, thus Alison could not
learn from her any knowledge of Goring's
movements, or whether he was at the camp,
or in Africa.  She was, in her isolation,
without the means of knowing if he were
in the land of the living.
</p>

<p>
So she was back again to Chilcote and
monotony, but a monotony that was not without
an infusion of hope that she might ere
long hear something of her lover; for Chilcote
and its vicinity were full of associations
connected with him, particularly their
trysting-place, the old beeches that were leafless
still, and looked so lonely when she lingered
there, and watched the brown rabbits scudding
among the last year's ferns; back again
to old Mrs. Prune's frugal repasts, and
watching for letters that never came, or
those that were not wanted&mdash;letters in blue
envelopes, at the sight of which Sir Ranald
shivered.  He hated all letters; of what use
were they to anyone&mdash;all he wanted was
his morning paper.
</p>

<p>
Severely ailing now, the old man had
become more querulous than ever, and
more than ever was Alison sweet in temper,
gentle and patient with him, for she had
more than an intuition that she would not
have him long with her, and when he passed
away what was to become of her <i>then</i>?
</p>

<p>
And she would look up beseechingly at
the portraits of the two brothers&mdash;the
Ranald and Ellon of other times&mdash;as if
seeking succour or counsel from them.
</p>

<p>
'I wish I had been born, papa, when
these two kinsmen lived, and when the
world was younger,' she said one day.
</p>

<p>
'A strange thought for a young girl,' he
replied; 'if you had been born then you
would have lived in stormy times, and,
instead of living now, be lying in St. Mary's
Kirk at Ellon.  But why this wish?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I think people were truer and
more single-hearted then than they are
now&mdash;more simple, honest, and less inclined to
make shams of themselves for appearance
sake.'
</p>

<p>
'Hum,' said Sir Ranald, after a pause,
during which he had been eyeing her
suspiciously through his gold <i>pince-nez</i>; 'have
you met anyone during your protracted
walk this afternoon?'
</p>

<p>
'Whom have I to meet in this lonely place,
papa?' she asked, with a little pang of
annoyance in her breast.
</p>

<p>
'No one you think worth your attention
now, perhaps; but you were most anxious
to return here, anyway.'
</p>

<p>
Alison did not reply, but a sigh escaped
her.  She had indeed on that afternoon
wandered pretty far on the road that led to
the distant camp at Aldershot, in the slight
hope of meeting him of whom her thoughts
were full, and to whom&mdash;in ignorance of
where he was&mdash;she feared to write
announcing that she was again at Chilcote.
</p>

<p>
Winter had come and gone while she was
at Antwerp; the snowdrops had faded from
white to yellow and passed away.  The
loose petals of the late crocuses, golden and
purple, had also disappeared under the
increasing heat of the sunshine; the garden
was fragrant with wall-flower and scented
jonquils, and as the days began to lengthen
the pale primroses came to spot the turf
under the old beech-trees, and within the
green whorls of leaves.  Ere long the
hedge-banks were gay with them among
the litter of dead foliage, and Alison thought
of the days when she was wont to linger
and make posies of them as she went to
school.
</p>

<p>
The sum that was to have been settled
on Alison in case Bevil fell in the intended
duel with Lord Cadbury had not taken any
tangible form, as the duel never came off,
in the first place, and, in the second,
Messrs. Taype, Shawrpe, &amp; Scrawly at that precise
time had been unable to discover the actual
whereabouts of the young lady; so she was
in ignorance of his kind consideration and
lover-like generosity, while they waited for
fresh instructions.
</p>

<p>
But, aware that to one so impecunious as
Sir Ranald Cheyne money could never come
amiss, Bevil Goring contrived, through the
Scottish legal agents of the former, to
transmit to his bankers for the use of Alison a
sum anonymously, or in such a fashion that
they could never discover, save from
himself, from whom or whence it came.
</p>

<p>
And the news thereof arrived one morning
when the holders of some overdue
accounts had been more than usually clamorous
for settlement, and Alison had begun
to feel once again some of the old emotions
of shame and desperation in her heart as in
the past, and her eyes were full of unshed
tears.
</p>

<p>
'What a world it is!' groaned Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
'True, papa; yet it is but little we require
or wish for.'
</p>

<p>
'We can neither have what we require or
may wish for, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What, papa?'
</p>

<p>
'We have money,' said he, gloomily.
</p>

<p>
'True.  Oh, that weary money!' sighed
the girl.  'However, we have still five
pounds in the bank, and in my purse are a
sovereign and some silver.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor, obstinate pet!  How easily all
this might be amended!  A dun, of course,'
he added, as the postman's rat-tat was heard
at the door, and Archie brought in a letter.
'Ah!  I thought so,' muttered the poor
baronet, as he saw that the envelope was
a blue one.  'Throw it in the fire; they
are all alike.'
</p>

<p>
However, with a snort of impatience, he
opened the missive, and as he read it
Alison, who was watching his thin face
with affectionate anxiety, saw an expression
of blank wonder, of utter amazement, steal
over it.  He started, and, as if he could not
believe his eyes, wiped his <i>pince-nez</i> with
his handkerchief and read the letter again,
while Alison, whose birthday it was, and
who sighed a little because there was no
one to remember it, stole to his side and
peeped over his shoulder.  It was from the
secretary of Sir Ranald's bank, to announce
that, by some friend unknown, £1,000 had
been paid in the name of Miss Alison Cheyne
for her use and behoof, and as a <i>birthday</i> gift.
</p>

<p>
Surprise profound and great joy were the
first emotions of father and daughter, and
the latter thought of all the little debts it
would clear and the comforts it would procure
for the former; but neither had the
slightest suspicion of the real donor, for
Goring was supposed to have little more than
his pay, and both were inclined to accredit
Lord Cadbury with it; thus for a time a
perilous emotion of deep gratitude began
really to fill the affectionate heart of Alison&mdash;we
say perilous, for it enhanced the prospects
of the peer, and might eventually
blight those of Goring, if aught occurred to
make Alison question his truth or loyalty to
herself, and yet her heart shrank with
shame at taking a money gift from her
rejected lover.
</p>

<p>
A birthday gift, she thought; Lord Cadbury
did not know her birthday.  Bevil
did; but of course this princely and certainly
opportune present could never come from
poor Bevil, who was thankful to add to
his income by slaving as a musketry instructor.
</p>

<p>
Beyond Cadbury conjecture was endless.
</p>

<p>
'Can it be from Captain Llanyard?' she
suggested.
</p>

<p>
'Absurd!' said her father, almost angrily.
</p>

<p>
Tom Llanyard, she knew with all a pretty
girl's sharp intuition, had admired her
greatly and secretly during the brief voyage
in the <i>Firefly</i>, and Tom, we are glad to
record, had, singular to say, in one day
realised a handsome fortune.
</p>

<p>
Alison knew of that circumstance, and she
knew too that Cadbury was too innately
vulgar not to be ostentatious with his wealth
and disinclined to hide his candle under a
bushel.
</p>

<p>
Tom Llanyard, with the <i>Firefly</i>, when
taking her to Cowes by Lord Cadbury's
orders, had been blown by a foul wind, and
in a heavy gale thereof, down the Channel
till he was off the coast of Devonshire, where
he fell in with a large derelict Indiaman,
which had been abandoned by her captain
and crew during the gale, and of which he
took possession.
</p>

<p>
He brought her into Dartmouth safely,
and she proved to be laden with teakwood,
rum, and a cargo valued generally at nearly
£100,000, consequently the salvage alone
proved a handsome fortune to worthy Tom
Llanyard, who immediately resigned 'the
honour' of commanding Lord Cadbury's
yacht.
</p>

<p>
The proud spirit of Alison revolted, on
consideration, at the idea of accepting or
using this money; but her father only asked
her how they were to 'rub on' without it,
now it had come?
</p>

<p>
But whence came it?  Was it sent in
charity, or was it the conscience money of
some false friend, who in the spendthrift
past time had wronged her father on the
turf or elsewhere?
</p>

<p>
To soothe her, he was not disinclined to
adopt this view of the matter; but to suit
his own views he again fell back upon the
conviction that the donor could be no other
than Lord Cadbury, to return it to whom
would be an insult, and whom it would be
but proper to thank in some fashion.
</p>

<p>
Thus, great was the surprise of the peer to
receive one day at his club a rather effusive
letter from Alison, dictated by Sir Ranald
to thank him for the birthday gift&mdash;as they
could not doubt&mdash;a gift that nothing but her
father's failing health, and the many
necessities that it involved, compelled her to
accept.  Her little hands trembled as she
closed this&mdash;to her&mdash;obnoxious epistle;
while her eyes were dim with tears, and
her heart wrung with shame and pride,
all the more so as she painfully recalled the
episode of Mr. Slagg and the acceptances.
</p>

<p>
Cadbury was puzzled sorely; he knew
not what to think, and tugged away at his
long white moustache, while thinking 'who
the devil can have sent this money&mdash;a
thousand pounds too!'
</p>

<p>
He was not sorry that they should think
the gift came from him.
</p>

<p>
'Hang it all!' he muttered, 'have I not
spent ever so much more on and about
her&mdash;Slagg's devilish bills too&mdash;and all for
nothing!'
</p>

<p>
So he wrote a very artful answer,
expressing his surprise that he should be
thanked for such a trifle, thus fully
permitting her to infer that the gift was a
kindness of his own; and more than ever
did Alison feel a humiliation, in which her
father&mdash;selfish with all his pride&mdash;had no
share, especially when sipping some very
choice dry cliquot 'veuve,' a case of which
he had ordered on the head of it, and
thought that for a little time at least he
had bidden good-bye to <i>mouton à la Russe</i>,
cold beef, and apple-dumpling&mdash;ugh!
</p>

<p>
At his club and elsewhere in London,
Cadbury had a nervous fear of the Antwerp
affair, and the cause of his sudden departure
from that city, oozing out.  It might find its
way from the <i>Rag</i>, of which he doubted not
Goring was a member, but Cadbury forgot
that the former was too much of a gentleman
to tell any anecdote that would involve
the name of a lady&mdash;more than all, that of
Alison Cheyne.
</p>

<p>
But no one can tell how stories get about
in these days, and thus, when there was any
low-voiced talk or laughter in a corner of
the club-room, he grew hot and cold with
the terrible suspicion that he was the
subject of both.  His hatred of Goring grew
deeper, and he resolved that he would work
him some fatal mischief, if he could.
</p>

<p>
Through Sir Jasper Dehorsey and Mr. Tom
Hawksleigh, a rumour certainly was
spread abroad that he had been on the
Continent 'with such a stunning girl;' and old
Cad (as he was often called) was rather
inclined to adopt the soft impeachment, and
the idea that 'he was a dog&mdash;a gay spark
yet&mdash;and all that sort of thing, don't you know.'
</p>

<p>
But when Dehorsey spoke of the affair,
he little knew the rank, position, or character
of the girl he referred to, and the risks
she had run through the brutal selfishness
and mischievous spirit of himself and
Hawksleigh, when by falsehoods, and in her
confusion, they had lured her to the Café au
Progrès.
</p>

<p>
At Chilcote, Archie Auchindoir speedily
became master of the news concerning the
birthday gift.
</p>

<p>
'A thousand pounds, my certie, is there
as much money in a' the warld!' he
exclaimed.  'Troth, Sir Ranald, he that hath
routh o' butter may put it on baith sides
o' his bannock.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know,' said Sir Ranald, peevishly,
to Alison, 'why I brought that fellow
back again.  A Caleb Balderstone is an
anachronism in nineteenth century society.'
</p>

<p>
'He is so good and faithful, papa&mdash;dear
old Archie.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but, like all such faithful old
fellows, he is a shocking tyrant&mdash;is too much
<i>au fait</i> at all one's private affairs, and
deems himself quite a family institution&mdash;as
much a Cheyne as ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
But Alison had not the heart to resent
Archie's gladness that the gift&mdash;whoever it
came from&mdash;'would keep the wolf from the
door,' as she thought it might keep the
black hound too!
</p>

<p>
Archie had a profound dislike of Lord
Cadbury, and once he ventured to say to
Alison,
</p>

<p>
'Wi' a' his wealth, I'd as soon see you in
your coffin as the Leddy o' Cadbury Court;
but anent this,' he asked, abruptly, in a low
voice, 'where is Captain Goring?'
</p>

<p>
Alison coloured, but said, in a low, cooing
voice,
</p>

<p>
'Could YOU find out for me, Archie, like
an old dear, as you are?'
</p>

<p>
'I will&mdash;I'll ask at the Camp, if I tramp
every yard o' the way and back again.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, thank you so much, Archie.'
</p>

<p>
'I would like to see you married to him,
missie,' said the old man, patting her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, we are too poor yet, Archie,' said
Alison, but the next remark, while it made
her laugh, brought a hot blush to her cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Owre puir!  Hoot, fye!  Think o' a
Cheyne o' Essilmont saying that&mdash;Essilmont
where mony a time a hundred o' your
name and mair have had their horses in
stall&mdash;ilk man boden in effeir o' war?'
exclaimed Archie, his old grey eyes flashing
as he spoke.  'No&mdash;it is feeding little
mouths ye think o'; but, odds sake, Miss
Alison, they'd bring mair gowd in their
yellow curls than they'd ever tak' frae ye
in bannocks and shoon.  God never sends a
little mouth into this world without food for
it; and, if it is a certain care, it is a sure joy.'
</p>

<p>
So Archie soon discovered that Bevil
Goring was not at Aldershot, and, to
Alison's joy, that he had not gone to Africa;
that the spring drills had not yet
commenced, that the battalion was returning
home, and that Captain Goring was in
London, where, she concluded, he must be
idling in ignorance of her movements, and
that she was again at Chilcote.
</p>

<p>
The year of their mutual promise was
already passing away.  But what did that
matter?  Never would they love each other
the less!
</p>

<p>
How she longed once again to see Laura
Dalton, whose new name and strange story
had reached her through the vicar, and amazed
her greatly, for she had a sorrowful sense of
isolation and helplessness, and this darkened
more around her, while heavy illness
once more fell upon Sir Ranald, and again
the terror came over her that his life would
slowly ebb away.
</p>

<p>
The scathing bitterness of his tongue
when he spoke of Goring often made her
heart wince, but could provoke no response
from her lips, though they often quivered
with indignation at his querulous spite.
Though Alison was a woman in energy of
purpose and power of endeavour, in many
ways she was still like the veriest
child&mdash;especially in so far as a spirit of reasonable
obedience to Sir Ranald went; and after all,
as a writer has it, even in these our days
'such monsters as parents indefinitely
relentless will sometimes outrage dramatic
proprieties;' so Alison pondered much upon
her future, but failed to see a clue to it.
</p>

<p>
In her present small world she had but
one little pleasure&mdash;her letters from her
namesake, Sister Lisette, the Beguine, full of
prayerful wishes, loving expressions, and
pretty messages, and often containing little
religious pictures, with gracefully worded
mementoes in Latin and French.
</p>

<p>
And thus the days stole away at Chilcote.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
CADBURY REDIVIVUS.
</h3>

<p>
Unabashed by Alison's steady rejection
of his suit, encouraged by the
countenance given him by Sir Ranald, who
had narrated to him in a letter written in
his now feeble and scrawly hand all that
had occurred subsequently to his missing
Alison in Antwerp, and more than ever
encouraged by the latter's missive with
reference to the mysterious birthday gift,
Lord Cadbury had the bad taste to resume
his old footing of more than visitor, and
attended by Gaskins, who had now
completely recovered, he rode over almost
daily from the Court to Chilcote, and was
wont to linger long, to the great annoyance
of Alison, though Sir Ranald, more ailing
and querulous than ever, lay frequently
a-bed till nearly noon.
</p>

<p>
Aware of the trick it could be proved he
had, in a spirit of malevolence rather than
to serve his master, played Bevil Goring
in Antwerp, and his confession thereof in
a moment of agony, weakness, and terror,
when believing himself to be dying in the
Belgian hospital, the rascal Gaskins was
very loth to venture within twenty miles of
Aldershot camp; but, while believing certainly
that the wronged officer of the Rifles
would never be at Cadbury Court, he was
less sure that he might not fall upon him in
the vicinity of Chilcote; thus he was greatly
relieved when, in reply to some casual
remarks, he elicited from Archie that Captain
Goring was in London.
</p>

<p>
So Gaskins felt his shoulders safe as yet.
</p>

<p>
'Our fare is no gude enough nae doubt
for a gentleman like you, Mr. Gaskins,'
said Archie, as he ushered the dandified
groom (whose surtout was girt by a waist-belt
and garnished with a rosebud button-hole)
into the kitchen, his whole face wearing
a contemptuous smirk the while; 'but
we can aye gi'e a bane o' cauld beef to
pyke, wi' a farl o' breid and a cogie o' gude
yill, and they are better, ye ken, than sowans,
ill-soured, ill-sauted, and sodden.'
</p>

<p>
'What the dooce is he saying, Mrs. Prune?'
asked Mr. Gaskins, in sore perplexity,
as he carefully wiped his cockaded
hat with a white handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
'Ye kenna what I am saying?' asked
Archie, with contemptuous surprise.
</p>

<p>
'No, Mr. Hackindore, you must excuse
me really.'
</p>

<p>
'Out of the world and into Kippen?'
said Archie, with a toss of his head.
</p>

<p>
'And how is Sir Ranald, Mrs. Prune?'
asked Gaskins.
</p>

<p>
'The laird is a wee thing dwining
again,' said Archie, ere she could reply.
'They say aye ailin' ne'er fills the
kirk-yard; but I'm fearsome at times this is the
last blaze o' the candle in the socket,' he
added, with a little break in his voice.
</p>

<p>
On the day of this visit Sir Ranald was
not visible at all, and Lord Cadbury had
Alison all to himself in the little drawing-room,
where he was fast resuming his old
airs of property and protection, and
almost venturing to make what he deemed
love in dull and emotionless tones; and
Alison, had she not been grieved by her
father's condition, and worried by the whole
situation, might have laughed at Cadbury's
Don Juanesque posing as too absurd.
</p>

<p>
'I shall never be able to describe to you,'
said he, for the tenth time, 'my profound
alarm and grief when I lost you so
mysteriously at Antwerp.'
</p>

<p>
'In a place to which I should never have
gone.'
</p>

<p>
'Not even with me?' he asked, softly.
</p>

<p>
'Not even with you; but I was weary,
triste&mdash;glad to do anything to forget my
own thoughts; but as for your friend
Captain Smith&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Alison&mdash;my dear Miss Cheyne&mdash;how
often am I to assure you that I know of no
such man?  If he was a Captain, in presuming
to call himself a friend of mine, and acting
as he did, he deserved the most severe
punishment; and let me assure you that as
we were in Belgium I should have lost no
time in inviting him to breathe the morning
air on the ramparts, or anywhere else,' added
Cadbury, in a valiant tone, even while wincing
at the recollection of the invitation he
had received for a similar 'breather' in the
Lunette St. Laurent.
</p>

<p>
'I thought duels were as much out of
fashion as hoops, patches, and hair powder,'
said Alison, with a little mockery in her tone.
</p>

<p>
'So did I, by Jove,' responded Cadbury,
with some fervour in his tone.  Then he
added&mdash;'And so Sir Ranald will not appear
to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;he is too unwell, and it is only when
I think of his condition,' said Alison, with a
quiver of her sweet lip and downcast eyelashes,
'I feel such gratitude to the donor
of my birthday gift&mdash;it has given me so many
things for papa that, I am not ashamed to
say, I could never have procured.'
</p>

<p>
'And you have got no certainty of who
sent it to you?' asked Cadbury, with a curious
and very artful modulation of voice, as
he slightly patted her hand.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;though I may strongly suspect,' replied
Alison, while a painful kind of blush
suffused her pale cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Suspect! can't you guess, rather?'
</p>

<p>
'Unless&mdash;it was you&mdash;or the kindest of
friends.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not admit quite that it was; but&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Admission or not, it <i>was</i> you,' said Alison,
with emotions of gratitude and humiliation
struggling in her proud heart, while her
beautiful eyes looked shrinkingly upward to
his; 'but, oh, my heart tells me, with fear,
that it may have come too late&mdash;too late.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not say so,' replied Cadbury, in his
kindest tone.  'If I have not graces of the
person to recommend me,' he added, in a low
voice, 'I have&mdash;it is admitted&mdash;great wealth;
if that will make you happy, it is yours&mdash;and <i>his</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot love you for what you may have,
and you cannot love me for what I have
only got&mdash;a loveless heart.'
</p>

<p>
'But I may love you for what you are.
There is a writer who tells that "it is finer
to be loved for what you are than for what
you have got," because the looks and money
often run away, but <i>you</i> remain&mdash;unless you
die, that is to say.'
</p>

<p>
'Again this detestable subject!' thought
Alison.
</p>

<p>
'I pity the loneliness of the life you lead
here,' said he, 'with your birds, fowls, and
flowers only as your companions.'
</p>

<p>
'And better to me as such, than some
people can ever be.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury was silent.  There was the old
dangerous glitter in his ferret-like eyes, and
he tugged at his long white moustachios,
but ere he could resume, Alison said,
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me, I must go to papa; I am sure
I heard his bell.'
</p>

<p>
So the peer withdrew, only to come next
day in 'his anxiety about the health of his
old friend.'
</p>

<p>
With poor Alison it was too often a case
of 'out of Scylla and into Charybdis,' as her
father generally resumed precisely where
Cadbury left off.
</p>

<p>
'Is he gone?' asked Sir Ranald, taking
her hand in his thin, wasted, diaphanous
fingers, and patting it tenderly on the
coverlet of his bed.
</p>

<p>
'Who, papa?'
</p>

<p>
'Cadbury.  I would speak to you about
him again.'
</p>

<p>
She made a little impatient and disdainful
<i>moue</i> at the name, but her father, heedless
of it, resumed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'In the winter of my days I have been
compelled to bury myself, and you too, darling,
in this dead-alive, man-forgotten
place&mdash;Chilcote; but I shall soon be out of it, and
you&mdash;my poor child&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
His voice failed him, and Alison's heart
failed her too as he spoke in this pitiful strain.
</p>

<p>
'As for loving Lord Cadbury,' said Alison,
with a voice that seemed full of tears, 'do
not talk to me of that when you are so ill
and feeble, as it wrings my very soul to
oppose you.  I may&mdash;nay, I must&mdash;be grateful
for the service his money gift&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Say gifts, Alison.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, gifts have done for you; but I can
do no more, my dislike of him is so intense
and rooted.'
</p>

<p>
'Dislike!  The proverb has it that a
woman's dislike is only love turned inside
out; and he loves you so!  Think of his
coronet.'
</p>

<p>
'A new one&mdash;the gilt not even worn by
time&mdash;a parvenu coronet.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said her father, impatiently, 'it will
be old in time; and does not the land teem
with parvenu baronets?  They are thick as
blackberries now!'
</p>

<p>
And Alison was thankful when he
dropped asleep, and she was left to her own
aching thoughts, and released from the hateful
subject for a time.
</p>

<p>
When a man of Cadbury's age and proclivities
conceives a fancy for a girl, he is
usually terribly in earnest about it; but 'of
that delicious agony&mdash;that glorious fear
which makes pallid the face of the lover&mdash;the
void in life which must be filled up by a
beloved woman&mdash;what did he know?'
</p>

<p>
Nothing&mdash;or what had he ever known,
old <i>vaurien</i> as he was?
</p>

<p>
In short, he came now, not to watch or
hope for recovery, but to learn how <i>ill</i> Sir
Ranald was becoming&mdash;the sooner the latter
was gone the better for his schemes.  The
baronet had altered greatly for the worse
in his mysterious and complicated ailment,
and the doctors who came&mdash;and, thanks to
the birthday gift of Alison, she had secured
the best medical attendance&mdash;shook their
heads gravely when they saw him; but not
in her presence, as, with professional humanity,
they wished to spare the poor girl any
unnecessary pain.
</p>

<p>
Cadbury often reflected with genuine
anger on how his plans for separating Alison
from her father on the Continent, that he
might both compromise and have her at his
mercy, had failed; and that he had barely
won, by any pretence, even her gratitude.
He had spent 'a devil of a lot of money&mdash;even
thousands one way or other,' and was no
nearer his end than before&mdash;fair means or
foul.
</p>

<p>
He had, moreover, been dreadfully insulted
at the Hôtel St. Antoine, 'by that cad
Goring,' and even put in terror of his
precious life!  And were all these to go for
nothing?
</p>

<p>
Never, perhaps, since Time was born did
a coward forgive the man who unmasked,
affronted him, or did him dishonour in every
way; thus more than ever was Cadbury
rancorous at Bevil Goring, and resolved to
revenge himself, through the means of Alison
Cheyne, if he could.
</p>

<p>
'As for Goring,' said he, on one occasion
to Sir Ranald, 'we know nothing of him
save that he bears a commission, which any
fellow who can pass the necessary exams,
can get now; but as to who he is, or where
he comes from, I don't suppose he could
very clearly tell himself.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald, though somewhat rancorous
in regard to his friend's rival, was patrician
enough to think such remarks unnecessary,
and only answered by a kind of sniff.  He
knew, on one hand, that Goring used the
arms of the Sussex Gorings, a chevron
between two annulets, dating from the first
Edward, while Lord Cadbury was what the
Scots call a 'gutter blood,' whose father,
the alderman, had, as recorded by Debrett,
been the first esquire of his race 'by Act of
Parliament.'
</p>

<p>
As for Alison, while undemonstrative, she
was passionate as Juliet, soft and tender as
Cordelia, yet none of the bloom had been
taken off her young heart by that playing at
love which is known as flirtation, 'ere
life-time and love-time were one.'  Alison,
perhaps, never knew what it was, and thus the
full harvest of her heart and soul had gone
forth to Bevil Goring, and she felt that, if he
failed her, life would 'have no more to
bring but mockeries of the past.'
</p>

<p>
She knew&mdash;with terror and foreboding of
woe&mdash;that the great and coming crisis in
that life would be her father's death.  She
had learned now to look that matter in the
face, and pondered thereon.
</p>

<p>
Then the winning ways and sweetly placid
features of Sister Lisette Gabion&mdash;features
that Fra Angelica might have painted with
joy&mdash;would come back vividly to memory;
and with them she recalled the peaceful
calm of existence in the Beguinage of
Antwerp, where no sound came from the world
without but the bells that called to prayer
and the sweet carillons of the great cathedral
tower; and many times there were when
she wondered, if Bevil failed her, could she
find a shelter there?
</p>

<p>
For already somehow he seemed to have
passed out of her life, though daily she
kissed the engagement ring he had placed
upon her mystic finger.
</p>

<p>
'Papa dead, I shall have no present and
no future,' wailed the girl in her heart, 'and
what will become of me?'
</p>

<p>
What if she had to go down into the
ranks of that great army which toils for
daily bread?  And with whom and in what
fashion would she earn it?  Thoughts like
these were corrodingly bitter for a girl so
young and beautiful, so delicate and tenderly
nurtured, as Alison Cheyne of Essilmont!

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
AT CAPE COAST.
</h3>

<p>
'What is he&mdash;who is he?' asked the
voice of one in authority, of one
evidently used to command, and who was
on horseback.
</p>

<p>
'An officer of the Rifle Brigade, sir,'
replied another.
</p>

<p>
'Dead, of course?'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir, but half dead of famine
apparently.  He looks pale enough, and his
haversack is empty.'
</p>

<p>
'How comes he to be here, and alone?
Poor fellow, he must have fallen out on Sir
Garnet's line of march, and been left in the
rear.'
</p>

<p>
Such were the welcome utterances in
English which Jerry Wilmot heard with
joy and astonishment, as, weakly and voiceless,
he struggled up on his hands and arms,
and looked around him again, to find a
mounted officer stooping from his saddle,
regarding him with interest and curiosity,
while twenty armed natives of a savage and
foreign race jabbered and gesticulated
violently as they lifted him from the ground,
and the other European who had spoken
applied a flask of brandy to his lips&mdash;a
requisite stimulant, of which Jerry partook
gratefully, while joy gushed up in his heart
to find that he was, so far as he could see,
saved.
</p>

<p>
And now to account for this mystery.
</p>

<p>
It is well known that four days after the
destruction of Coomassie, that city of
wigwams in a woody wilderness, a single
British officer, attended by only twenty African
soldiers, rode through the still smouldering
ruins, and found no inhabitants remaining.
</p>

<p>
This officer was Captain Reginald Sartorius,
of the 6th Bengal Cavalry, who had
been sent by Captain Glover, R.N., to report
to Sir Garnet Wolseley that he was advancing,
and was now within eighteen miles of
the city with his subordinate column, the
operations of which lie somewhat apart from
our story, though we may briefly state that
'the original scheme, and the elaborate
attempt of a campaign starting from the
Volta river, with from ten thousand to
fifteen thousand warriors of several nations,
had not indeed been carried out.  The
native kings had willingly accepted British
money, and flint-lock muskets for their
men; but their idea of invading Ashantee
was to go away in another direction, and
make war on people out of the Gold Coast
Protectorate, and beyond the range of its
policy.  Neither at Addah nor at Accra
could we get a real hold of the allies, upon
whom Captain Glover had reckoned.  He
had, therefore, been instructed by Sir
Garnet to conduct his own reliable force of
Houssas and Yorabas by a given route
across the Prah, and join our main body at
Coomassie.'
</p>

<p>
In obedience to orders, and to report the
approach of this force, at mid-day on the
10th of February Captain Sartorius, starting
from a point which he believed to be
only seven miles distant from that place,
began one of the most daring rides recorded
in the annals of war, and for which he won
deservedly the Victoria Cross.
</p>

<p>
Certain of meeting Sir Garnet at
Coomassie, he departed without provisions,
and, after a rough ride of eleven miles
through a wild and terrible country, he
found himself when night fell at a village
seven miles distant from it.  There strange
and startling rumours prevailed among the
women, for the men had all gone elsewhere.
Coomassie, they told him, was no more,
and its destroyers had departed.
</p>

<p>
Captain Sartorius sent messengers to
Captain Glover, stating that Sir Garnet
would only be a day's march off, and could
easily be overtaken; but these messengers
were fired on in the bush, and no tidings
reached the naval officer.
</p>

<p>
Moving on with caution, next day
Sartorius approached Coomassie, which was
still shrouded in clouds of dark smoke, amid
which the red flames were smouldering, and
was met by a woman, who informed him
that 'the king and all his young warriors
were in the town raging over its destruction,
and vowing vengeance for it.'  Three
houses alone had escaped the conflagration.
</p>

<p>
Aware that scant mercy would be shown
to him and his twenty brave followers if
taken, he quickly left that place of horrors
behind him.  Believing that he was now
equi-distant between Captain Glover and
Sir Garnet, he bravely resolved to follow
up the latter, a fortunate circumstance for
the luckless Jerry Wilmot, who was found
in the very track his party was pursuing.
</p>

<p>
'Come, my good friend,' said he, after he
had heard Jerry's story in a few words,
'you must pull yourself together and make
an effort, as we must push on without a
moment's delay.'
</p>

<p>
An effort&mdash;yes, thought Jerry gleefully,
though he was weak, faint, and feverish, for
his adventures in the moist and pestiferous
bush were telling on him now.  But for the
advent of Captain Sartorius, what must his
fate inevitably have been?  He was mounted
on the horse of a messenger, who had been
shot in the bush, and now rode on with his
rescuers.  The sheet of water which had
barred his way so long they forded, the
water rising to their saddle-girths, and then
they pushed on, hoping to reach the bridge
constructed by our engineers across the
Ordah.  It had been swept away!  But
the waters which destroyed it had subsided,
and where that waste of water, so troublesome
to our troops, once rolled, the ground
was dry and even hard, but the odours that
loaded the air from the bodies of the slain
Ashantees lying in the bush, left Captain
Sartorius and his companions in no doubt
of their being on the line of march followed
by Sir Garnet Wolseley.
</p>

<p>
Poor Jerry had felt himself like one in
an evil dream when he found his limbs so
powerless that he was incapable of resistance
and sinking on the earth.  Now he
felt also in a dream, and could scarcely
realise that he was mounted, with friends
and on the homeward way, for he was half
dead with weakness, and, if not rescued
when he was, he must have succumbed very
soon after.  Keenly had he realised the
fact that
</p>

<p>
  'Past and to come seem best, things present worst.'<br>
</p>

<p>
Some one proffered him a cigar&mdash;a luxury,
to a smoker a necessity&mdash;which he had been
without for days, and he took it thankfully,
gratefully, and never did he forget the
pleasure that cigar afforded him; but the
toil of the journey, after all the blood he
had lost and all the mental and bodily
suffering he had undergone, told sorely
upon the nerves and system of Jerry,
though a hardy and active young Englishman,
who had never figured second in the
hunting or cricket fields, had been stroke
oar of the Oxford boat, and up to everything
in the way of sport that was manly
and stirring.  But he dug his knees into his
saddle, and even when his head, through
very weakness, was almost bowed on his
horse's mane, he thought of Bella Chevenix,
and bravely, as he phrased it, 'strove to
keep up his pecker.'
</p>

<p>
So onward the party progressed amid
scenery clothed with strange trees, strange
flowers, and gigantic plants, with long spiky
blade-like leaves, such as we only see in a
botanical garden at home.
</p>

<p>
There was a lurid sunset, and the hills
were as those of heaven, as described by
Dante, 'like sun-illumined gold,' when the
party of Sartorius drew near Amoaful,
scaring away all Ashantees who approached
him, and then when night fell he came upon
a wounded Houssa who had fought against
us, but gave him the pleasant intelligence
that the British troops were at no great
distance&mdash;at Fomannah&mdash;where Sir Garnet
halted four days, and messengers came from
the King of Ashantee with 1,000 ounces of
gold, and the latter received a treaty of
peace in return.
</p>

<p>
The lonely march was resumed in the
morning, and at Fomannah Jerry Wilmot
and Sartorius, with his twenty men, after
having marched, each with arms and forty
rounds of ammunition, for fifty-five miles,
overtook the retiring troops of Sir Garnet
Wolseley.
</p>

<p>
Jerry now had 'that ugly knock on his
sconce,' as he called it, properly dressed
and attended to by the medical staff, in
whose hands he found poor Dalton done
nigh unto death by wounds, and borne
among the sick in a hammock, and ere long
Jerry was the occupant of another,
prostrated by fever, and unconscious of most
that followed.
</p>

<p>
Oblivious of the struggle of the night
march to the village of Akanquassie, through
a moonless, starless, and pitchy blackness
never equalled; through a swamp, over a
precipitous hill, and anon through a forest,
where every moment one ran against a tree,
had the helmet knocked off by a bough,
the face scratched by twigs and spiky
shrubs, or the foot stumbled over a great
gnarled root; yet the voices of the officers
and men rang cheerily out as they encouraged
each other.
</p>

<p>
'Close up&mdash;close up.  Now then, my lads!'
</p>

<p>
'This way&mdash;this way.  Look out!'
</p>

<p>
'For what?'
</p>

<p>
'A deep pool of water.'
</p>

<p>
'Mind that root! mind that branch!'
</p>

<p>
'Hurrah, lads!  Forward!'
</p>

<p>
And as the dawn stole in the men of the
1st West Indian Regiment, who escorted
the party of sick in hammocks, seemed to
Jerry's eyes most ghastly in their light grey
clothing and white helmets; and it was said
that 'the negro so dressed looked like a
convict who had been hung until black in
the face and cut down.'
</p>

<p>
And often as he tossed in his hammock,
which was slung on a pole dhooley-wise, he
would mutter,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, if Dalton had only let that &mdash;&mdash; beetle
alone!'
</p>

<p>
Cape Coast Castle was reached by the
entire force in pretty good condition; but,
as an idea of the extent to which fever had
raged among them, we may mention that of
the Naval Brigade, which, including marines,
landed two hundred and seventy-eight
strong, there came back only one hundred
and nineteen men.
</p>

<p>
All the rest had found their last homes in
the awful solitude of the untrodden bush.
</p>

<p>
Apart from sorrow lest he should never
more see Laura and his little daughter so
lately found and known, Dalton had a great
horror of finding such a tomb, and being
left so far away; and the funeral of a brother
officer, Captain H&mdash;&mdash;, who had died at
Essiman of fever, haunted him like a
dream.
</p>

<p>
He remembered how the forest re-echoed
to the three death volleys over the lonely
grave, which lay in a beautiful spot,
certainly so far as tropical flowers and foliage
went, and had as a headstone a stately
cotton-tree; but ages may elapse ere the
foot of a white man treads near it again.
</p>

<p>
All the fire of the soldier seemed to have
gone out of Tony Dalton; and for a time
only the ailing and pitiful invalid remained;
and he longed intensely for the presence
and the ministering tenderness of the
brilliant Laura&mdash;more perhaps to feel in his
the little white hand of Netty&mdash;the <i>enfant
terrible</i> of the past time at Chilcote Grange.
</p>

<p>
Genuine hope first expanded the hearts
of Dalton and Jerry, and in the hearts of
many more, when they heard the pipes of
the Black Watch strike up&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh, why left I my hame?<br>
  Why did I cross the deep?'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
announcing that the white walls of Cape
Coast Castle were in sight, rising apparently
sheer out of the jungle, and that beyond
them lay our stately ships of war, and the
free rolling waves of the blue highway that
led to home and 'Old England.'
</p>

<p>
'Rescued, safe, spared to see the white
cliffs again&mdash;home and Bella!' murmured
Jerry.
</p>

<p>
Of his mother, though a warm-hearted
fellow, he scarcely thought, or if so, it was
in this fashion:
</p>

<p>
'By nature icy, with all her beauty and
pride of place, she is my mother, true; but
what has she done for me?  As a child, she
never caressed me, as other fellows' mothers
did&mdash;no, by Jove, nor tucked me in my little
bed, nor gave me toys or sweets.  Did I ever
see her read her Bible in church, or teach
me to say a prayer at her knee?  She only
cared to see me prettily dressed, that I
might outshine other women's children, but
left me otherwise to hang as I grew; and,
by Jove, it is a wonder I didn't grow up a
worse fellow than I have done!'
</p>

<p>
With half a world of waters between
them, these were hard thoughts for a son
to have of his mother; but Lady Wilmot
had inspired them herself.
</p>

<p>
Both Dalton and Jerry were in such a
bad plight from their wounds, and the latter
especially from exposure in the bush, that
the doctors doubted much if they would
'pull through' after the embarkation, as
they were ever and anon tossing on the
troubled tide of a jungle-fever that
threatened to bear them both away to the shores
of 'the Promised Land,' with a grave in the
tropical sea.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
THE OLD WARNING.
</h3>

<p>
Fondly had Alison Cheyne looked forward
to her return to Chilcote, as a
chance of reunion with Bevil Goring, as the
means to a probable end of taking up the
link of their love where it had last been
dropped; and now she had to content herself
with the scanty intelligence gathered by
Archie among the soldiers of his regiment,
that he was not in the camp&mdash;was in London,
but none knew in what part thereof.
</p>

<p>
In London, thought Alison, and making
apparently no effort to write, or to discover
her; but she forgot that he must be utterly
ignorant of her movements; whether she
was at home or abroad; and that she could
now receive letters freely and unquestioned,
as her father was all but bed-ridden again.
</p>

<p>
Her bubble seemed to be bursting; and
this state of affairs&mdash;nothing&mdash;was the end
of it, after all!
</p>

<p>
Thus they were both in painful ignorance
of each other's movements amid all the
ready appliances of post and telegraph,
while Laura Dalton, who would have been
a certain means of communication between
them, was gone from Chilcote Grange, Alison
knew not where, but, as it eventually
proved, to Portsmouth to await the
returning expedition from the Gold Coast.
</p>

<p>
So Alison's days were passed in nursing
and monotony now, and often she and
Mrs. Rebecca Prune had their heads together
over a cookery-book, studying the decoction
or preparation of something 'for papa'&mdash;to
tempt his appetite; for often <i>he</i> had one
dish and Alison another of a more homely
kind, or next to none, and though he might
have a dainty spring chicken she dared not
kill her hens, they were laying so well just
then.
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald had become, as Lord Cadbury
remarked rather unfeelingly to Alison,
'deuced stupid and snoozy now.'
</p>

<p>
On an evening early in March he sat&mdash;as
Alison long remembered&mdash;for the <i>last</i> time
in his old arm-chair listening to the rooks
cawing in the lofty beeches, the sparrows
twittering under the eaves, and the setting
sun was throwing a golden glory over the
eastern uplands and a ruddy gleam on the
square, ivyed tower of Chilcote Church in
the distance; and then, without moving his
head, which lay back on a pillow, his eyes,
clear and keen though sunken, through the
<i>pince-nez</i> balanced on his long thin nose,
regarded lovingly and affectionately, the
downcast face of Alison, whose pretty
hands were adjusting in a vase some
fragrant March violets that Archie had brought
her&mdash;violets which, as Shakespeare says,
are 'sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes.'
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time Sir Ranald had found
it a burden&mdash;a bore to sign a cheque, to
read a letter, or see his lawyer when he had
a land steward; now there were no cheques
to sign, no letters to read save those of
duns, and no lawyer to see, or land steward
either; and now, for the last time he began
to harp upon the old string, when she kissed
him, and asked him of what he was
thinking.
</p>

<p>
'Of what can I think save your future,
Alison? who cares what becomes of mine&mdash;little
as there is left of it, and tired as I am
of a life that is too intolerable to be
endured for one's-self alone!' was the querulous
response.
</p>

<p>
Alison with difficulty restrained her tears,
and in a mechanical way re-adjusted the
bouquet of violets.
</p>

<p>
'Girls&mdash;especially poor ones&mdash;have only
a certain number of chances, Alison,
however handsome and attractive they may be,'
he resumed.  'You, under great monetary
disadvantages, have had one that is every
way unexceptionable.  What more do you
want&mdash;what more can you want?' he added,
rocking his bald head from side to side, and
closing his eyes wearily.
</p>

<p>
Alison thought she had had two chances,
and the most prized of them was now a
richer offer than she ever deemed it could
be; but this was the one her father chose to
ignore as no chance at all.
</p>

<p>
'I have read, papa,' said she, 'that those
"who have neither character nor conscience
may drift, or let others shape the course for
them; but the great thing is to be true to
yourself."'
</p>

<p>
'Yourself&mdash;and some penniless cur, like
that at Aldershot!  Go&mdash;I am disgusted!'
exclaimed Sir Ranald, with a sudden gush
of querulous anger.
</p>

<p>
Alison remained silent.  She knew not
that the fatal end was drawing so near now,
otherwise she must have temporised with
him more; and she thought&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'But for my love for Bevil, to please
papa I might have yielded&mdash;so many girls
are drawn or thrust into hateful or grotesque
marriages by want of money, friends, or a home.'
</p>

<p>
But when she thought this, Alison was
ignorant of what so many knew, and her
father should have known&mdash;the private
character of Lord Cadbury, or rather his
want of it, as he was simply an old <i>vaurien</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Novels have turned your head, Alison,'
said Sir Ranald, in a low voice.  'You expect
to be over head and ears&mdash;of a necessity&mdash;in
love with a hero; well,' he added, through
his set teeth, 'this fellow Goring is not
one&mdash;didn't he shirk the Ashanti affair?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, how cruel and unjust of you!
He won three medals, and was twice wounded in India.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! you know all that?'
</p>

<p>
'He was "detailed" for the depôt, as it
is called&mdash;so Archie told me&mdash;and had to
remain at home.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! you know all that too!' exclaimed
her father, weakly, but in a sneering tone.
</p>

<p>
Why did not Bevil attempt to seek her
out? she thought.  Had a change come
over his mind and his plans? and was she
left in loneliness to dream over the unattainable?
</p>

<p>
'It is not medals I would have you to set
store upon, but money.'
</p>

<p>
'I care little about it, papa, and shiver at
the name of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so; but we ought to care for
what money gets us.'
</p>

<p>
'Should I accept Lord Cadbury with your
permission if he were a poor man?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not,' he replied, snappishly;
'even a poor Lord would be no mate for
Miss Cheyne of Essilmont&mdash;for my daughter!'
</p>

<p>
'But if she is poor too?'
</p>

<p>
'Then the greater madness to think of it.
But I am weary of this subject.'
</p>

<p>
'So indeed am I, papa.'
</p>

<p>
'And I am weary of life too&mdash;oh, so
weary&mdash;but for you, bird Ailie!  Ring for
Archie&mdash;and&mdash;and let me to bed&mdash;to bed.'
</p>

<p>
So he went to his bed that night, and
never rose from it, for he was dying&mdash;dying
partly of a general decay of the whole vital
system; for he was a man who had lived
high, and with whom life, if easy in one
way, had been a species of feverish chase in
another.
</p>

<p>
In anxious monotony passed the nights
and days.  Dr. Kneebone, the Esculapius of
Chilcote village, could do nothing for him
now; indeed, there seemed nothing to be
done but to watch for the end; and as Alison
watched, with a heart torn by anxiety,
passionate filial regard, and terror of what
must inevitably come, again her sweet face,
the softness and delicacy of which the pencil
of a Greuze alone could have pourtrayed,
became sad and pale and livid.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes grew heavy and inflamed by
much sleeplessness, and over all her bearing
there spread a soft air of patient suffering
with equal evidence of great resolution and
fortitude; and yet&mdash;yet, withal, with a
shudder in her heart, times there were when she
began to think of sacrificing herself, if doing
so could save her father and prolong his days.
</p>

<p>
And old Archie Auchindoir moaned to
himself as he pottered about his daily work,
and often he muttered anxiously:
</p>

<p>
'It's no for nocht the gleds whustle at
nicht!'
</p>

<p>
Dying&mdash;Dr. Kneebone assured Lord Cadbury
that the old man was certainly dying,
and fully stronger than ever grew the hopes
of the peer to possess Alison, the poor and
forlorn, beautiful and hunted creature, in the
midst of her coming desolation and loneliness.
Genuine pity or commiseration he had
none.
</p>

<p>
'Save the puir lassie, he is the last o' the
Cheynes o' Essilmont, my lord,' said Archie,
in a very broken voice, as he ushered the
peer out one day; 'the last leaf o' a lang,
lane: ancestral tree!'
</p>

<p>
'What the devil is the use of a family tree
unless one could sell it for timber,' replied
the peer, as he took his horse's reins from
Gaskins; 'and as for ancestors' (this was
rather a sore subject with him), 'if one could
raise the wind on them, there is many a fellow
who wouldn't even leave himself a father
just now!'
</p>

<p>
And so his lordship cantered off, sitting in
his saddle, as Archie said, 'for a' the warld
like a pock o' peats.'
</p>

<p>
Alison was watching her father sleeping,
while this would-be lover rode pleasantly
home to his luxurious dinner, and, as she
watched him, she thought how fearfully wan
and gray his face looked; and yet how noble
it was in its manly beauty.  What a handsome
youth he must have been, when he
won her mother's heart as a girl.
</p>

<p>
'How dark it has become!' she murmured
in a low voice, as Archie brought noiselessly
in a carefully shaded lamp, 'and the sunset
was so unnaturally bright,' she added, in a
kind of whisper, with a convulsive trembling
of her lips and a strange pitifulness and
foreboding in heart as she resumed her seat by
the bedside, in shadow.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Kneebone had looked at the sinking
patient for the last time, and departed with
a very grave face&mdash;grave, for his kindly heart
was full of pity for the young girl, who now
knew that the great change would come
before long.
</p>

<p>
The vicar of Chilcote had read the
prayers for the dying, and not without deep
emotion, for he was a warm-hearted old
man; and after placing the book in Alison's
hand, with certain pages marked for her
perusal, had departed also; and she&mdash;declining
all offers of feminine assistance from
the vicarage&mdash;remained alone, and choked
with emotion by the bedside, with one of her
father's passive hands clasped in hers, to
wait and to watch.
</p>

<p>
A storm was rising without, but great
was the hush of silence in the half-darkened
chamber as the hours of the night stole
solemnly on; and Archie and Mrs. Rebecca
Prune, approaching the door on tip-toe,
peeped in from time to time, but were always
warned away by a wave of Alison's hand.
</p>

<p>
On the mantelpiece ticked a handsome
little carriage clock, one of the few remaining
relics of former wealth and luxury; but
the sound it made was soon lost amid the
din of the elemental war without.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice Alison mechanically turned
her pale and hopeless face to the window;
the bare black branches of the great beeches
were tossing on the gale, and dark clouds
were hurrying past the white, weird disc of
the moon; eerily wailed the blast around
the old house, rustling the rain-soaked
creepers on its walls, and the great drops
swept in gusts upon the rattling window
panes.
</p>

<p>
The patient stirred restlessly; the din of
the rising storm&mdash;oh, could she but muffle
it, shut it out&mdash;disturbed him.
</p>

<p>
Higher it rose, and with each successive
gust of the increasing wind the ivy and
creepers rattled on the window panes,
whilst the great beeches seemed to shiver
in anticipation of a fiercer blast.
</p>

<p>
For many a year to come would a storm
be associated with sorrow, gloom, and
death in the mind of Alison Cheyne!
</p>

<p>
The thunder growled, and more than
once a gleam of lightning overspread the
northern quarter of the sky, showing the
tall trees in black outline tossing their
branches wildly.
</p>

<p>
The sound thoroughly roused Sir Ranald,
and recalled his dying energies.
</p>

<p>
'Kiss me, bird Ailie&mdash;kiss me,' said he,
in a voice like a husky whisper; 'the light
has surely gone out, I cannot see you,
child.'
</p>

<p>
Alas, it was the light of life that had left
his eyes for ever!
</p>

<p>
Alison saw how fixed they were in
expression as she kissed him softly, most
tenderly, again and again, and wiped his
forehead with her handkerchief.  Then,
with hands that were tremulous but firm in
intent, he drew down the lids of his eyes&mdash;as
James VI. of Scotland did, with wonderful
presence of mind, when dying, and no
other man on record&mdash;and they never opened again!
</p>

<p>
Alison thought he was asleep, and listened
to his stertorous breathing, while
restraining her own; it grew fainter and
fainter, but there was a sound in it that is
indescribable, though more significant than
any other, that a human soul is on the
wing; while his shrivelled hand groped
feebly and fatuously about the coverlet as
if seeking for another; and, taking it
between her own, Alison bent her lips over it.
</p>

<p>
It trembled in her grasp, and when she
looked up he had passed away, and an
awful placidity lay upon the livid face.  At
that moment the thunder was grumbling,
and the wind bellowing; so it might be
fancy, or it might not, but amid the tumult
of sound Alison seemed to hear&mdash;what was
it?&mdash;the wild baying of a hound dying
hollowly away in the distance.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my God,' she exclaimed, and fell
prone, face downward, with arms outspread,
upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
The hound&mdash;the hound again!  Was it
fevered fancy?  Could she but think she
was warring with shadows&mdash;but alas, she
could not, then at least.
</p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
'ASHES TO ASHES.'
</h3>

<p>
When she opened her eyes with a sob
and a gasp, she found herself in the
arms of Archie and Rebecca Prune, and
while her little white hand wandered in
bewilderment across her brow, she moved
her head from side to side, and looked
vacantly, wearily, and inquiringly around her.
</p>

<p>
At last she realised it all, and rushed to
the bedside.
</p>

<p>
'He has left ye, my bairn,' said Archie,
in a broken voice, 'but God bides wi' ye
yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, come back to me&mdash;I cannot
live without you, papa!  Do not leave me
thus, all alone, all alone!' she wailed out,
as she buried her face in the bedclothes,
and threw her arms across the stiffening
form, till the old man, by an exertion of
strength that was great for his years, bore
her bodily away to her own room, and left
her there with Mrs. Prune.
</p>

<p>
Fast as the storm drops without, the tears
rolled over her pale cheeks, while she
sobbed as though her heart would break;
nor did the kind old woman who hung over
her, and caressed her poor aching head by
pressing it against her maternal breast,
attempt to check Alison's passionate weeping,
which proved alike a safety valve to her
brain and heart, till, worn out with all she
had undergone for days and nights past, a
heavy sleep came upon her.
</p>

<p>
Old Archie hung over her for a minute
ere he left her, and thought what a lovely
face hers was to look upon, pale and
exhausted though it was in expression.  The
forehead low and broad, the eyebrows dark,
yet delicately marked; the waxen-like
eyelid fringed by long lashes that lay lightly
on the cheek; the rosebud mouth so full of
sweetness and decision.
</p>

<p>
We must hasten over this gloomy portion
of our story, and get, with Alison, into the
busy world once more, for her father's death
led to many changes.
</p>

<p>
In connection with that event, the real
or fancied sound she had heard preyed
deeply on her mind, and the only person
to whom she could speak, brokenly and
with quivering lips, on the subject&mdash;Archie
Auchindoir&mdash;believed in the existence of
the supernatural so thoroughly that he left
nothing unsaid to confirm her in the belief.
</p>

<p>
All people are now incredulous of everything,
and to none other but Bevil Goring
would she have spoken on the subject&mdash;and
yet with her it had much of the superstition
of the heart in it.  Men of science assert
that there is no evidence that the ordinary
course of nature is ever interrupted.
According to their theories, 'there never have
been, there are not now, and there never
will be, either miracles or opposition.
Between the orthodox, who doubt modern
supernaturalism, and the men of science,
who are sceptics all round, the strange
thing is that anyone should arise to express
a belief which is so contrary to the spirit of
our time, though we have by analysis and
investigation laid our hands on many things
hitherto sealed'&mdash;to wit, gas, electricity, the
telephone, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Be all this as it may, we tell the tale as
it was told to us, and hope the hound of
Essilmont, if it bayed at all, did so for the
last time.
</p>

<p>
At Chilcote the first day of death stole
quietly on.  Prostrate with grief, Alison
remained in her own room, leaving all that
was to be done with the vicar, the doctor,
and Archie, who, plunged in sorrow great
as any could feel who shared not the blood
of the dead man, hovered about her in a
helpless kind of way, as if he would have
striven to console&mdash;yea, almost to caress
her.  Was she not the child he had carried
often in his arms? but, as he phrased it,
'he wistna what to do.'
</p>

<p>
And as the girl sat in her room, careless
of who came to the house or left it, with
the one awful conviction upon her that he
had passed away 'to that unutterable
mystery and greeting which mortal eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard.'  Her beautiful face
grew all lined and haggard, and her
dark-rimmed eyes, in their peculiar glitter, told
of many a sleepless night and of much
mental anguish.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury, as we have elsewhere
said, hated sick-rooms, 'and all that sort of
thing;' still more did he hate death-beds,
funerals, and all connected therewith.  And
when last at Chilcote, seeing that the end
was not far off&mdash;indeed, the doctors had
said so&mdash;he went back to town to await the
final catastrophe, 'the double event,' that
would rid him of a querulous friend, and
place that friend's daughter more
completely at his mercy&mdash;yea, and the mercy
of Fate!
</p>

<p>
In reply to the posted announcements of
the death, his card came to Alison in a
black-edged envelope, sealed with his
coronet in black wax.  He did not attempt&mdash;even
with all his pretences and past
protestations&mdash;to indite a sham letter of
condolence, nor did she miss it.
</p>

<p>
'Dead&mdash;dead at last!' muttered Cadbury,
as he sat in the sunny bow-window of the
club looking out on busy Pall Mall, his
ferret-like eyes glittering cunningly and
leeringly as he tugged his white, horseshoe-shaped
moustachios.  'Well, he's a loss to
no one but the girl herself&mdash;not even to his
creditors now&mdash;the vain old Scotch pump,
with his pedigree and his ancestry, his
heraldry and his beggarly bosh!  But I
would like to know who the devil sent that
mysterious thousand pounds!  It may be a
trump-card for me yet.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury began to consider his plans
anew.  He would get Alison up to London
and give her a letter of introduction&mdash;as
companion or something of that kind&mdash;to a
now somewhat <i>passé</i> 'lady friend' of his,
who occupied a tiny villa at St. John's
Wood, and drove a brougham, of course,
who would 'soon contrive to make it all
straight for him;' and he chuckled as he
thought of the success that, through her,
would eventually be his.  Anyway, the
proud Alison would find some difficulty in
'cresting up' her haughty little head after
her residence at St. John's Wood.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury could not come to the
quiet and hasty funeral at Chilcote; he was
'too indisposed.' Certainly Alison did not
want him.  She had had quite enough of
the peer, and hoped never to see his face
again.
</p>

<p>
'Better awa', Miss Alison, better awa';
his absence is guid companie,' said Archie,
who could not endure Cadbury, and loathed
his dandified groom Gaskins.  ''Od, missie,
he's worth nae weal that canna bide wae.
May he dee like a trooper's horse, wi' his
shoon on!' added Archie, through his set teeth.
</p>

<p>
So as a hateful dream the details of death
passed on.  'Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.'  The
vicar's voice fell clearly in the calm
spring air on the ear of Alison as she leant
on the doctor's arm, for very few were
present at the funeral, and these few, save
Archie, were strangers; but her soul seemed
to shrink within her as she heard the shovelfuls
of gravel pattering down on the polished
coffin-lid and the large metal plate,
which bore the name and age of
</p>

<p class="t3">
  'SIR RANALD CHEYNE, BART., OF THAT ILK<br>
  AND ESSILMONT.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The last of her race, save <i>herself</i>!
</p>

<p>
'Surely, surely, if he is in England, Bevil
will come to me now when he hears of this
calamity!' she whispered in her heart, as
she sat in the solitude of her own room
when all was over.
</p>

<p>
But Bevil Goring came not.  He had
never had explained to him the cause of
her abrupt and mysterious flight or departure
from Chilcote, and the subsequent trip
in Cadbury's yacht, and why, or how, she
had neither time nor opportunity to write
to him the briefest note of farewell or
enlightenment on the subject; but all that had
nothing to do with his absence on the
present occasion, as we shall relate anon.
</p>

<p>
But she was brooding sadly over it,
while&mdash;declining the proffered hospitality of the
vicarage&mdash;she sat in her loneliness, watching
the stars as they came out one by one,
thinking of the bitterness and brevity of
human life, and marvelling how many millions
of the human race these orbs had
looked down upon, and would yet look
down upon, in the ages to come.
</p>

<p>
Her father's spendthrift errors in youth,
and his petulance and selfishness in old age,
were all forgotten by Alison now.  She
remembered only his love for herself, and
even repented that she could not gratify
him by sacrificing herself to Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
Would she have prolonged his life by
doing so?  That was a problem on which
she could not&mdash;dared not dwell.
</p>

<p>
His tenants&mdash;or rather those who had
been his tenants&mdash;far away among the Braes
of Aberdeenshire, longer than they might
have been, but for the merciful consideration
of his creditors&mdash;men who, even in
this advanced age, deemed themselves born
vassals of the house of Cheyne, as their
fathers did when the Red Harlaw was
fought, or the Brig o' Dee was bravely
manned in the days of Montrose&mdash;were
stirred with much genuine grief when they
heard of his death.  For, though proud to
his equals, he had ever been a friendly and
kindly landlord to them, and thinking of
them ever, in the good spirit of the olden
time, as 'my father's people,' he would
shake warmly the hand of old Donald
Gordon, the gudeman of a little farm-town,
while asking after his wife and daughters by
name; though he would barely nod his
aristocratic head to some 'earth-hungry'
commercial man, who had acquired a fine
estate&mdash;all won by honest industry.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, why does not Bevil come to me; if
in England, he must have heard of papa's
death?' was her ever recurring thought.
</p>

<p>
And he did hear it; but, by a strange
contingency, a little too late.  Meanwhile,
not much time was given Alison to linger in
desolate Chilcote, and she found that, a day
or two after the funeral, she would have
to face the cold and bitter world&mdash;yea, and
to face it alone, tender, young, and
inexperienced as she was!
</p>

<p>
Sir Ranald's death brought the last of his
creditors swooping down upon the dregs
and lees of his possessions, and, with a heart
that seemed broken afresh, Alison surrendered
to them everything, even to that heirloom
which her father deemed the palladium
of the Cheynes&mdash;the great silver
tankard that had been the gift of Elizabeth,
Queen Dowager of Scotland, to Sir Ranald
Cheyne of Essilmont and Inverugie, the
master of her household.  And she wept
with the knowledge that to have parted
with that would well-nigh have broken her
father's heart.
</p>

<p>
The mysterious thousand pounds were
spent&mdash;all save a little sum; but the last
of her father's smaller debts had been paid,
and his last days soothed by many a comfort.
So Alison preferred to leave Chilcote&mdash;for
ever, and Archie pressed her sorely
to accept, in whole or in part, his carefully
treasured 'three hunner pounds,' but pressed
her in vain.
</p>

<p>
Memories of the Beguinage and of sweet
Sister Lisette came over her now; but
no&mdash;no&mdash;even if they would take her there for
what her hands might do, it would seem
like a relinquishment of Bevil Goring and
life too.
</p>

<p>
'I am sure, Archie, I could teach little
children&mdash;give lessons in music or something
in London,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'And I'll gang to London too, missie.'
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose?'
</p>

<p>
'Odd's sake, missie, to tak' care o' ye.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor, dear Archie!' said the girl, softly,
with a sob in her slender white throat.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by this retainer, she paid a
farewell visit to the churchyard of Chilcote
Vicarage, where, amid the bright sunshine
of spring, the earth seemed at its fairest,
and the quaint, old, picturesque fane of the
Norman days, moss-green, ivy-grown, and
tree-shaded, was casting its shadows across
'God's Acre.'
</p>

<p>
She laid a chaplet of flowers, woven by
her own loving hands and watered by her
tears, on her father's grave&mdash;that spot
which to her no sunshine could brighten&mdash;the
spot where he lay, without a stone as
yet, the last of an old, old warlike and
historic race; and then she prayed for the
dead&mdash;a prayer, it is said, never offered up
in vain; for though the petition may be
refused, still the petitioner may be rewarded
in some fashion for the generous and unselfish
prompting, and we are told it is good to
pray for them, that they may be loosed
from their sins.  So Alison prayed by her
father's grave, while her faithful follower,
who stood thereby hat in hand, had his mind
full of prayerful thoughts that could take
no form of utterance, for Archie was a
true-blue Presbyterian, and knew not how to
pray for those who could no longer do so
for themselves; and then the pair crossed
the churchyard stile in silence and passed
away.
</p>

<p>
Old, wrinkled, sour-visaged Archie
Auchindoir, with keen grey eyes, white hair,
and saturnine cast of features, was a strange
'Squire o' the Dames,' or <i>Escudero</i> (as
the Spaniards would have it), for a handsome
young girl, albeit that she was in the
deepest mourning; but no one could be
more kind, loving, and reverential, for poor
Archie loved the very ground his young
mistress trod, and watched over her as a
father would have done.
</p>

<p>
And so, with this peculiar attendant,
Alison bade adieu to old Rebecca Prune,
quitted Chilcote, and, furnished with a letter
of introduction from the vicar, set out by
second class for London by an early train
on her melancholy pilgrimage; and many a
poor girl has thus set forth to earn her
bread without the honest consolation and
support of a vassal so tender and true.
</p>

<p>
Piqued as she was now beginning to be
by the knowledge that Bevil Goring was in
London, when he might have been seeking
her, especially amid her sorrow, in the
country, she was not without hopes&mdash;but
oh, how slender they were!&mdash;of perhaps
hearing something of him in that vast
human wilderness towards which she was
being hurried.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
EVENTS PROGRESS.
</h3>

<p>
The whole expedition was now returning
from the Gold Coast, save those who
had found their graves in the wilderness on
the advance to Coomassie, and in the fighting
incident thereto.  Among those returning
were the two hundred and sixty-eight
wounded officers and men.  The number of
deaths in proportion was small as compared
with those in recent European conflicts&mdash;a
fact explainable by the arms and ammunition
used by the Ashantees; first, their
old-fashioned firelocks and use&mdash;not of bullets,
but slugs, projectiles which soon lost their
velocity after discharge, and were easily
stopped after penetrating the body, the
stronger bones of which they were incapable
of breaking; and lastly, by the total absence
of artillery.
</p>

<p>
The telegraphic wire made people at
home aware that many of the Rifle Brigade
had died on the voyage homeward between
the Gold Coast and Madeira; that the
Welsh Fusiliers had only twenty men on
their sick-list; and the hardy Highlanders
very few, though they had to regret the
death by wounds of their major, William
Baird, who had served with them for
twenty years, and been at the siege and fall
of Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
It was known in England that many of
the sick and wounded were to remain in
the hospital ships, <i>Victor Emmanuel</i> and
<i>Simoom</i>, or were landed at Ascension and
the Cape de Verde Isles for medical treatment;
but, as no officer of the Rifles was
recorded as among these, Laura with her
daughter, escorted by Goring, had betaken
herself to the port which is the great
headquarters of the British navy, to behold
the arrival of the victorious troops from
Ashantee, and for whom a great ovation
was prepared.
</p>

<p>
People from London and elsewhere
crowded in thousands to witness their
landing.  In the hotel where Laura and
Bevil Goring were, there were more than
one old Scottish veteran officer of the
Crimea, and even of the Peninsular war,
who had come from the land beyond the
Tweed to see, as they said, 'their dear old
Black Watch again;' and more than one
lady in widow's weeds, some young, some
elderly, with their little brood, come to
look again upon the ranks of the Welsh
Fusiliers and the Rifles, though there a
beloved face would be seen no more.
</p>

<p>
How gladly would poor Bella Chevenix
have gone too; but she had no valid
excuse&mdash;no friend or chaperon going save Laura,
of whose movements she was ignorant; so
she had but to wait, in the secluded village,
the tidings given by the newspapers, but
with more impatience and certainly less
equanimity than Lady Julia at splendid
Wilmothurst.
</p>

<p>
Greater was her love for Jerry than the
latter could actually realise; for, with all
her past coquetry, Bella was one of those
ardent and impulsive girls that a man only
comes across once in a lifetime, or, it
maybe, thinks so.  She knew that Jerry was
comparatively safe when the fleet sailed,
but she had heard with dismay of deaths
among the Rifles ere it reached Madeira;
so it may be imagined how eagerly and
anxiously she watched the public prints,
and learned that on the 19th of March the
English people had the joy of welcoming
home, first the 23rd Welsh Fusiliers, as
they landed from the <i>Tamar</i> at Portsmouth,
where, among many other graceful gifts, a
regimental goat was presented to them in
lieu of their famous Indian one, which had
died on the coast of Africa; and anon of
the more brilliant ovation which was
reserved for the heroic Black Watch when the
soldiers of the latter came in the <i>Sarmatian</i>,
and, prior to landing, had gleefully
discarded their grey tunics and white helmets
to resume their national uniform, the kilt
and bonnet, so known to martial glory.
And then came the Rifle Brigade and the
Royal Engineers on board the mighty
<i>Himalaya</i>.
</p>

<p>
How Laura's heart beat while she clung
to Goring's arm and clasped little Netty's
tiny hand, when the signals announced that
the ship was about to enter that great
harbour which is the most spacious and secure
in the British Isles, though less than a
quarter of a mile in breadth at the
narrowest part of the entrance.
</p>

<p>
'There she is,' exclaimed Goring, 'just
rounding South Sea Castle!'
</p>

<p>
Laura's bright hazel eyes grew dim as she
watched the approaching ship.  It seemed
to her as if it was but yesterday, in one
sense, since she had seen the transport
depart with the Rifles after her reconciliation
and reunion with Dalton; and yet, so strong
are the impressions of the human mind,
that it also seemed as if it were ages ago;
and now&mdash;now he was coming home, though
but perhaps the wreck of himself, to her
and their little Netty&mdash;the husband and the
father from whom they had been so long
and unnaturally separated!
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, she has her ensign half
hoisted!' exclaimed a voice among the
thousands of whom she formed a unit.
</p>

<p>
Goring had remarked this through his
double field-glass, yet said nothing of it to
his fair companion, lest she might be
unnecessarily alarmed.
</p>

<p>
'What does it mean?' she asked him
more than once, ere he replied, unwillingly,
</p>

<p>
'It means that there has been a death on
board.'
</p>

<p>
'A death!' she said faintly, as she recalled
the loving tenor of Dalton's last farewell
letter to her, written like Jerry's to
Bella on the night before Coomassie was
entered, and of the fatal telegram that told
of his serious wounds.  'A death, Goring?'
she repeated, with a wild expression in her
beautiful eyes, while her cheek grew snowy
white as she watched the slowly approaching
ship, which was under half steam now.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, marm,' said an officious old sailor,
who was regarding the stately vessel through
an old, battered telescope tied round with
spunyarn; 'some poor fellow has lost the
number of his mess, for there is a coffin
covered by a Union Jack in one of the quarter
boats, as you may see for yourself, marm.'
</p>

<p>
He proffered his telescope civilly enough,
but Laura shrank closer to the side of
Goring, who remained silent, for he too had his
own thoughts.  She could not look; her
eyes felt sightless, and her poor heart
seemed to die within her with the most fearful
forebodings.
</p>

<p>
The bands of several regiments stationed
at Portsmouth were now filling the sunny
air with music, and the cheers of the Riflemen,
clustering like bees along the sides of
the mighty ship, were responding to the
united voices of thousands on the shore,
giving those hearty and joyous shouts that come
from British throats and British lungs alone;
and Laura, under all the pressure of the
occasion and her own terrible thoughts, was
on the point of fainting, as the transport
came slowly abreast of the sea-wall, when
Goring threw an arm round her, and exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
'Thank God, there is Dalton&mdash;there is dear
old Tony at last!'
</p>

<p>
'Where&mdash;oh, where?' asked Laura, in a
breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
'At the back of the poop,' he replied, lifting
Netty aloft on his shoulder, as they now
saw an officer&mdash;Dalton, indeed&mdash;with a face
white as his tropical helmet, with the pallor
that comes of suffering and much loss of
blood&mdash;waving his handkerchief to them in
recognition, for the ship was very close
inshore, and Laura was soon to learn that the
melancholy freight in the quarter-boat was
the body of a poor sergeant who died off the
Lizard, and whose widow&mdash;believing herself
yet a wife&mdash;was awaiting him on the pier
with a babe at her breast&mdash;the babe his eyes
would never look upon.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes more the steam was
blowing off, and Goring with those in his
care joined the stream of the privileged few,
who poured along the gangways on board.
</p>

<p>
'God is very merciful,' murmured Laura,
as she laid her face on Dalton's breast,
heedless of spectators.  'He has given you back
to me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'From the very gates of death, dearest Laura.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what should I have done if you had
perished, my darling?&mdash;oh, my darling,' she
said, in a low voice of exquisite tenderness
as he embraced Netty&mdash;Antoinette so named
after himself, and grown up to girlhood
without his knowledge of her existence.
</p>

<p>
'Bravo,' cried a hearty voice familiar to
them all; 'as Albert Smith used to say,
"<i>C'est l'amour, l'amour, l'amour, qui fait le
monde go round, O.</i>"  Thank God I see you
and Old England again, Laura,' and Jerry
Wilmot kissed her with hearty goodwill.
</p>

<p>
Like Dalton, Jerry was very pale and
wan; but not so feeble as the former&mdash;and
from the effects of his wounds and fever
could scarcely stand, even yet.
</p>

<p>
The ovation that followed the landing of
the Rifles may be fresh in the recollection of
many.  Balls, banquets, and addresses were
amply accorded to all the returned troops,
and decorations and crosses for valour were
fully bestowed; but of all the joyous
entertainments Bevil Goring saw nothing, as a
notice which he read by chance in a paper
led him to leave Portsmouth on the evening
of the very day the regiment landed.
</p>

<p>
It was simply a paragraph in a Southampton
paper, on which his eye fell casually,
that rooted him for a few minutes to the
spot, and ran thus:
</p>

<p>
'We understand that the late Sir Ranald
Cheyne, Bart., of Essilmont and that ilk,
whose demise at Chilcote we recorded some
days ago, has died without heirs male, and
his baronetcy, one of the oldest in Scotland,
has thus become extinct.'
</p>

<p>
'Who died some days ago at Chilcote,'
thought Goring, who felt a species of shock;
'and Alison is thus alone&mdash;alone in the
world&mdash;poor girl!  At Cadbury's mercy
perhaps&mdash;while I&mdash;oh, what must she think
of me?  Why do I only hear of this
calamity now?'
</p>

<p>
So next noon betimes saw him arrive at
Chilcote with his horse at a rasping gallop,
and his heart beating high with mingled
hope, love, and great commiseration, as he
knew how Alison idolised the querulous old
man she had lost; and again, as before, his
spirit sank on finding only silence and
desolation&mdash;the house abandoned and all its
windows shuttered.
</p>

<p>
'Desolation, as before,' he muttered, as
he leaped from his horse; 'desolation, and
perhaps mystery too.  Where can she have
gone, and with whom?'
</p>

<p>
He passed the gate, and mechanically
handled the door-knocker, and the sound
thereof echoed hollowly through the silent
house.  He drew close to the shuttered
windows, and peeped in through a fissure
in one.  He saw the almost entirely darkened
dining-room, from the walls of which
the portraits of the two cavalier brothers
were still looking grimly and stonily down;
on the table was a vase, with a few flowers
still in it; and near stood a chair and a
work-basket, in which some coloured wools
were lying.
</p>

<p>
Very recently must Alison have been
there, as the flowers seemed still somewhat
fresh; in fact, she had only set out on her
pilgrimage the day before, when he had
been at Portsmouth.
</p>

<p>
How full the place seemed of her
presence!  Yet he had to turn sadly away.
</p>

<p>
The buds in the giant beeches were
bursting already into tender green leaves;
the birds were twittering and singing in the
hedgerows, and the kine lowed amid the
deep spring grass of yonder meadows; 'the
deep bell' swung in the distant tower of
Chilcote Church; the dogs barked sharply
in an adjacent farm-yard; and close and
nigh was the hum of the bee, as it thrust
its golden head into the cups of the spring
flowers in the now neglected garden.
</p>

<p>
To his senses all seemed unchanged as
when he last saw Alison there; and where
was she now&mdash;his love&mdash;his promised wife?
</p>

<p>
Where again was she gone?  Into the
hard and chilly world&mdash;all the colder and
more perilous now that her father was dead,
and that she must stand alone in it?
</p>

<p>
Alone!
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring felt his heart wrung by
irrepressible anxiety, and he bethought him at
once of appealing to the vicar of the parish,
who could not fail to possess some
information on the subject.
</p>

<p>
The latter received him with considerable
suavity, for he was a kind-hearted old
gentleman, but eyed him keenly under his
bushy white eyebrows.  He had heard&mdash;but
how, he knew not, for gossip spreads
fast in a secluded country parish; yet he had
heard that there was a young officer from
the camp, who was wont to hover near
Chilcote Beeches, and who was eminently
distasteful to the late Sir Ranald, for reasons
best known to the latter; so the worthy
vicar fashioned his answers accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Bevil, however, learned that Alison had
been resident for many weeks at Chilcote
after her return from the Continent, and
prior to the demise of her father.
</p>

<p>
Many weeks! thought he, and yet she had
never written, as she might have done, to
his address at the camp, whence letters were
forwarded to his address in London.  Poor
Alison had not written because she knew he
was absent, and, moreover, she was sorely
pre-occupied at home.
</p>

<p>
Was she under the influence of Cadbury? thought
Bevil.  Oh, that was impossible!
Yet Goring began to feel, as Alison often felt,
that their engagement&mdash;that its many
trammels&mdash;was a very peculiar one, and would
be so while her father lived.  Now he was
gone, and wealth had accrued to Goring,
yet they were as much apart as ever!
</p>

<p>
'Sir Ranald was dead, yes,' he heard the
vicar saying, 'and buried near the ancient
yew in the churchyard, where Miss Cheyne
meant in time to erect a marble cross.'
</p>

<p>
'That shall be my duty,' observed Goring.
</p>

<p>
'Yours?' said the vicar, inquiringly, and
again the bushy brows were knitted.  'Poor
man! he is sleeping where I know he did
not want to lie, in my churchyard; yet he
will sleep as soundly there in English earth,
let us hope, as if he lay among his
ancestors in Ellon Kirk, among mailed knights,
mediæval bones, and the <i>Hic jacets</i> of other
days,' he added, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'Where has Miss Cheyne gone to?'
</p>

<p>
'London,' replied the vicar, curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Can you give me her address?' asked
Goring, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'May I ask who inquires?' said the vicar.
</p>

<p>
'I sent in my card&mdash;Captain Goring, of
the Rifle Brigade.'
</p>

<p>
'Just returned from Ashantee?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay,' replied Bevil, colouring with honest
mortification, 'I was detailed for home
service.'
</p>

<p>
'And now stationed at Aldershot?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! a bad place Aldershot&mdash;a very
centre of dissipation, I fear.  May I ask if
you are a relation?'
</p>

<p>
'I am not.'
</p>

<p>
'A friend?' queried the vicar.
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;one most deeply interested
in Miss Cheyne.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought so,' rejoined the vicar, eyeing
him keenly and with a curiously provoking
smile while playing with his gold eyeglass;
'may I ask how and why?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly&mdash;I am engaged to her.'
</p>

<p>
'Her <i>fiancé</i>?  asked the vicar; 'is that
what you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and now <i>where</i> is she?'
</p>

<p>
'I regret&mdash;regret to say&mdash;that&mdash;that I
have not yet her present address.  She
only left this for London yesterday.'
</p>

<p>
'In other words, by your tone,' said
Goring, haughtily, as he rose and took his
hat, 'you know it, but decline to give it to
me?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not say so,' replied the vicar, also
rising, as if the interview was ended; 'but
for the present you will excuse me saying
more.'
</p>

<p>
'Sir!' exclaimed Bevil, with some heat.
</p>

<p>
'Goring&mdash;Goring,' muttered the vicar,
eyeing Bevil's card; 'it is strange that the
young lady never spoke to me of you,
though in her grief she several times
mentioned another friend.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!&mdash;who?'
</p>

<p>
'Lord Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'Cadbury!' exclaimed Goring, with a
contemptuous inflection of voice that did
not escape the listener.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; who, by a very ample remittance&mdash;a
thousand pounds, I believe&mdash;did much
to ease and soothe her poor father's last
days on earth.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
Whew! here was intelligence.  His birthday
gift had been attributed to, and evidently
adopted by, that reptile Cadbury!
And, finding that there was nothing to be
made of the suspicious and over-wary vicar,
he withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had Goring, disappointed and
dispirited, taken his departure, when Lord
Cadbury, accompanied by Gaskins, having
found Chilcote deserted, arrived at the
vicarage to make the same inquiries, but
with very different intentions.  Impressed
by the years and rank of his second visitor,
the vicar admitted that he was cognisant of
Miss Cheyne's movements, and, on consideration,
promised to send her correct address
to Cadbury Court when she wrote to him
from London; for, knowing the helplessness
of the young girl, even with Cadbury was
the vicar wary.
</p>

<p>
Dalton remained at Chilcote Grange to
be nursed by Laura; Jerry departed on sick
leave to Wilmothurst, while Bevil Goring
remained with the battalion at Aldershot to
undergo the drudgery of the spring drills
in the Long Valley, and await in a kind of
silent desperation with hope to hear
something of Alison.
</p>

<p>
How terrible to endure was this period
of an inaction that was enforced by
circumstances over which he had no control, and
many a hearty malediction he bestowed
upon the close old vicar of Chilcote.
</p>

<p>
Often he opened the clasp of her
ring&mdash;Ellon's ring&mdash;and gazed upon her tiny lock
of hair, now faded and withered by the
heat it had undergone when 'up country'
in the Land of the Sun, and on her pictured
face he gazed till his eyes ached and burned
with the intensity of his longing to see the
features smile, the lips unclose, in fancy.
</p>

<p>
We are told that if a man, 'overborne by
any grief or pain&mdash;not the more endurable
because no outward sign can be discerned&mdash;should
go forth into a crowd to seek for
solace, the chances are that he will return
in a more discontented frame of mind than
that in which he set out, simply from realising
the fact how infinitely little his own
sufferings affect the most of the world at its
work or play.'
</p>

<p>
Amid the bustle, gaiety, and business of
the crowded camp at Aldershot, Bevil Goring
realised all this to the fullest extent.
</p>

<p>
Day after day went by and brought no
news of Alison, either to Goring or to Laura
Dalton, whom he saw frequently, and hope
deferred was making the heart of the young
officer very 'sick' indeed; but, though he
wrote a very important letter to his solicitors
at Gray's Inn Square concerning certain
properties at Chilcote, he went there no
more.
</p>

<p>
In the words of L.E.L., he could no more
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
BELLA'S DOT.
</h3>

<p>
Lady Julia Wilmot had been in
hope that when the Ashantee 'affair'
was over, Jerry would settle down, 'marry
money,' free his ancestral seat from
encumbrance, and take a proper pride in it; but
for a time after the capture of Coomassie it
had seemed that she was to be afflicted by a
double calamity&mdash;that the estate was lost,
and Jerry might never return.
</p>

<p>
It was not in her aristocratic nature to be
very much moved about anything.  Excitement
or enthusiasm of any kind was 'bad
form,' she deemed.  Thus, if she was not
plunged in profound grief when she heard
of the poor fellow's supposed death, neither
was she greatly excited with joy when she
heard that he was safe and coming home
again.  To this noble daughter of twenty
earls, an only son more or less in the world
really seemed of no great consequence,
unless it were, if he 'married money,' to serve
her own ends.
</p>

<p>
When tidings of Jerry's death came, she
had attired herself most becomingly in
fashionable mourning of the requisite depth
of wear, as understood by the drapers in
Regent Street.  Round her white throat
were narrow tuckers of yellowish-white
lace, and a rustling train, spread over a
crinolette, floated behind her.  Now that
he was safe, her mourning was relinquished,
almost with a sigh, we fear, it was so
becoming; and Floss's mother-of-pearl basket,
which had been duly lined with black silk,
was now refitted with blue satin.
</p>

<p>
She received Jerry in her usual stately
fashion; gave him her cool, slim hand to
press, which he did heartily, while his eyes
moistened; and accorded her smooth and
unlined cheek for his salute, and then his
welcome ended.  So ere long Jerry began
to think, as Mrs. Gaskell's novel has it, that
John Thornton's mamma might be wrong
when she says, 'Mothers' love is given by
God, John.  It holds fast for ever and for
ever.  A girl's love is like a puff of smoke,
it changes with every wind.'  But then
there was nothing aristocratic about stalwart
John Thornton's mother.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chevenix had always loved Jerry
for his father's sake, and for the sake of
the 'Wilmots of Wilmothurst,' who had
been of Wilmothurst, 'and that ilk,' as
the Scots would say, for time out of
mind; but there his regard ended; he had
small care for Lady Julia, and, when tidings
came of Jerry's death, after a moderate
time had elapsed he resolved to take the
mortgages in hand and assert his rights&mdash;in
short, to make the property, what it now
almost virtually was, his own, and to request
Lady Julia to leave the place, to crush her
false and insensate pride in a heart that
seemed without any other human sentiment.
</p>

<p>
'He has formally announced the foreclosure
of the mortgages, this man Chevenix,
Emily,' said Lady Julia, with some
consternation&mdash;at least for her&mdash;as she opened her
letters one morning.  'The crash has come
at last!'
</p>

<p>
'What does that mean, aunt?' asked the
young lady.
</p>

<p>
'My lawyer tells me it means the act of
foreclosing&mdash;cutting off the equity of
redemption, and that the money would not be
taken in payment, even were poor Jerry
alive and had it to pay.'
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Chevenix had chuckled as he
gave these instructions, for he had endured
enough of Lady Julia's aristocratic caprice,
and knew how she had often treated his
Bella, a girl certainly second to none, 'as if
she were the dirt of the earth,' as he said,
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
But Bella had deplored these sharp
measures, for she felt that a strange but
tender and undefinable tie bound her to
Jerry Wilmot, dead or alive.
</p>

<p>
As children she and Jerry had been
permitted to be playmates, and she had been
somewhat of a pet with his father, the old
Squire; but it was not until they had grown
up, till he had been at college and then
joined the Rifles, that Lady Julia felt that
the intimacy was&mdash;well, unfortunate, and to
be finally snubbed.
</p>

<p>
The shock given to the sensitive Bella by
the perils encountered by Jerry&mdash;first the
report of his death, and subsequently the
account of the precarious condition in which
he had embarked at Cape Coast, caused her
many terrible nights and days, and nearly
threw the poor girl into a fever, as she had
none in whom to confide her sorrow, or her
secret love; but sorrow rarely kills, and
though at first fretful and resentful, with
the memory of Lady Julia's want of proper
affection, she was very gentle, quiet, and
patient, and besought her father not to
foreclose the mortgages yet a while; but he,
out of all patience with non-payment of
interest on one hand, Lady Julia's hauteur
and insolence on the other, with the great
doubt entertained of Jerry ever coming
home to keep the fragment of Wilmothurst
that yet accrued to him, had put the matter
in the hands of his legal agents, who,
curiously enough, were Messrs. Taype,
Shawrpe, and Scrawly, of Gray's Inn; and
things were at a serious crisis when Jerry
returned home to find a deadlier enmity
than ever in his mother's heart at 'that
creature Chevenix and the forward minx
his daughter.'
</p>

<p>
The latter knew of Jerry's arrival; her
heart had beat responsive to the clangour
of the village bells, the music of the
volunteer band which preceded the carriage in
which he came, and the cheers of the
warm-hearted rustics, who unharnessed the
horses and drew it along; and ere long she
heard with pity and anxiety from Mademoiselle
Florine, whom she chanced to meet,
that he was confined to his room&mdash;even to
his bed&mdash;by a return of the treacherous
jungle-fever, which is apt to recur at times
unexpectedly for months after recovery is
thought certain; and while in this condition,
helpless and incapable of action, he was
galled and tormented, and his jealousy was
roused by his mother and cousin Emily
with the real information of how the matter
of the mortgages stood; that Lord Twesildown
had heard of them, and with an eye
to possessing Wilmothurst and Langley
Park intended to degrade himself by
proposing for Bella Chevenix, now that she
would be a Hampshire heiress, as his
mother, Lady Ashcombe, had the very bad
taste to inform them.
</p>

<p>
And Jerry writhed in his bed when he
heard of these things, and times there were
when he wished that after all he had found
his grave, like many more, on the wooded
banks of the Prah.
</p>

<p>
Twesildown had an estate, though a rather
encumbered one; but he had also a title
and undeniable good looks.  Jerry was
now well-nigh a landless man.  Bella had
suspected, he feared, the purity and
disinterestedness of his love, and thus
circumstances, he thought, were all against her
viewing him with favour.
</p>

<p>
If the worst came to the worst, and he
were sold up, he would effect an exchange
for India, and think of her no more.
</p>

<p>
No more&mdash;how hard it was!
</p>

<p>
Just then, in his soreness of heart, Jerry
was not sorry that a legitimate fit of illness
detained him in the house at Wilmothurst,
and separate from Bella; for he was hourly
stung by tidings&mdash;exaggerated in some
instances&mdash;that Lord Twesildown was daily
giving her drives with his mother, and
mounts of his best horses; and, as he was
known to be rather impecunious, and quite
<i>au fait</i> of the fact that Bella Chevenix was
her father's heiress, Jerry felt jealous,
mortified, and bitter.  He even sorely
regretted the 'gushing' farewell letter he
had written to her before entering Coomassie;
and could little conceive that even now, in
a silken case, she wore that letter in her
bosom!
</p>

<p>
It was quite evident how hotly jealous he
was of Twesildown, and this sentiment
Cousin Emily left nothing undone or unsaid
to fan.
</p>

<p>
'How you chatter, cousin,' said he, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'I am like the brook, you think, on this
subject,' said Emily, with one of her
sweetest smiles.
</p>

<p>
'What brook?'
</p>

<p>
'I go on for ever.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, you do&mdash;and with a will, too!'
said Jerry, who was now stretched at full
length in a hammock netting between two
trees on the lawn, lazily enjoying one of the
last box of cigars he might open in Wilmothurst,
as his family were contemplating a
removal therefrom, and for where was quite
undecided.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chevenix had courteously left his
card for Jerry, so Bella knew that, come
what might, the latter in common civility
would call ere long; and to that event she
was looking forward now; but days passed,
and Jerry came not.
</p>

<p>
And so while Bella, remembering the
tenor of her last farewell meeting with
Jerry, and that of the treasured letter,
which amounted to a declaration, was eating
her heart out with disappointment that
he made no effort to see her, he was daily
being 'primed up' by Cousin Emily with
jealousy of Twesildown; and <i>this</i> was the
time to which he and she had both looked
forward so eagerly!
</p>

<p>
The bitterness of this situation was
enhanced to Jerry by the knowledge that his
ancient inheritance of Wilmothurst was
Bella's <i>dot</i> and known to be such by
Twesildown, to whom it was a lure quite as
much as her undoubted brilliance and
beauty.
</p>

<p>
'There is the devil to pay and pitch-hot
here about the mortgages,' he wrote to
Bevil Goring; 'and moreover, old fellow,
I am sorely disappointed in my love affair.
I have read that what "drives one man to
drink drives another to the <i>demi-monde</i>."  Whether
of the two is worse, the immortal
gods can tell.  Either remedy is worse
than the disease, I fancy!  But anyway a
few months more will see me again broiling
up country, and going in for iced drinks and
Chinsurah cheroots.'

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
IN BAYSWATER.
</h3>

<p>
'Twenty years old to-day&mdash;twenty
years!' murmured Alison, as she
glanced at herself in the little mirror, and
thought how pale and how much older
than her age she looked in her plain black
mourning dress, which was destitute of
other ornament than smooth white cuffs
and a ruche or frill of lace, or some such
soft material, round her slender throat.
</p>

<p>
Vividly came back to the girl's memory
her other birthdays, ere poverty fell upon
her father, and ere she was&mdash;as now&mdash;alone
in the world, and when each recurring
anniversary found her loaded with caresses,
congratulations, and pretty presents.  And
she could recall her fourth birthday at
Essilmont, when she was a little child in a
white embroidered frock, with a broad sash
matching the colour of her dark blue eyes,
with her brothers, Ranald and Ellon, eating
strawberries off a huge salver held for them
by Archie Auchindoir, who seemed an old
Archie even then.
</p>

<p>
Never more would the kisses or caresses
of father or mother touch her brow or
cheek; and now she was in the ranks of
those who have to earn their daily bread as
a governess on thirty pounds per annum,
teach French, English, and music to two
little girls of the ages of nine and ten
respectively.
</p>

<p>
And sadly on this day she thought of all
that had befallen her, and how completely
Bevil Goring had passed out of her life,
apparently for ever!  Wearily too her eye
went round the bare school-room in that
stately house in Pembridge Square,
Bayswater&mdash;a long, low-ceiled apartment, with
two windows that overlooked Westbourne
Grove, a grove only in name now.
</p>

<p>
The vicar of Chilcote procured her this
situation, and, beyond her name and his
recommendation, her employer, Mrs. S. De
Jobbyns, knew nothing of Alison Cheyne
and cared not to inquire.  The vicar had
written lately to state that a handsome marble
cross&mdash;a Celtic one he believed it was
called&mdash;had lately been placed by a friend above
her father's grave, and Alison's heart swelled
with gratitude as she read of it.
</p>

<p>
It must have been done by Lord Cadbury,
she thought.  Who else could have done so?
</p>

<p>
She had now been two months in Pembridge
Square&mdash;two whole months&mdash;and
despite the unwonted drudgery of teaching,
and the dreariness of routine&mdash;despite slights,
almost insults, that were offered, perhaps
unconsciously, by the cold-hearted and the
underbred, the time had slipped quickly
away.
</p>

<p>
Thus condemned to the dull drudgery of
daily teaching a couple of troublesome,
peevish, and ill-tempered brats in that bare
and comfortless school-room, was Alison, a
loving and passionate girl, made more
passionate, loving, and tender by the sore
griefs she had known, but all unsoured by
these and the doubtful prospect&mdash;yea, the
utter blank of her future.
</p>

<p>
Though the change of condition was not
much to Alison, the change of <i>position</i> and
that vacuity of the future were frightful to
the poor girl; and in taking the situation for
the sake of her father's name and his old
family pride, though he was now in his
grave, she had besought the vicar of
Chilcote, in recommending her to Mrs. S. De
Jobbyns, to conceal what she had ever
been&mdash;nay, was still&mdash;the daughter of a
baronet of Nova Scotia, whose diploma
dated from 1625.
</p>

<p>
The family of Mrs. Slumpkin De Jobbyns
consisted of three daughters, the eldest
Miss Victoria, of whom more anon, was in
her nineteenth year, and Alison's two pupils,
Irene and Iseulte.  Like the rest of the
snobocracy of the metropolis she believed
in double names, thus she figured in the
royal Blue-Book as Mrs. Slumpkin De Jobbyns,
a style of address which would have
astonished her late husband, worthy old
David or D. Jobbyns, as he called himself,
when for many a year he was acquiring
wealth as an industrious soap-boiler in Bow
East, and when he married pretty little
Sally Slumpkins, the barmaid at the 'Black
Swan' in Mile-End Road, and when she
little foresaw how wealthy a 'relict' she
would be left.
</p>

<p>
Pretty Sally, who had, of course, preferred
the worthy soap-boiler to his rival
the potman, had now, amid ease and
much good living, expanded into a stout,
blousy, and coarsely-featured matron, greatly
puffed up by wealth, success, pride, and
vanity.
</p>

<p>
She always wore the richest materials and
the most massive jewellery, and never
omitted to figure in her open carriage in
the Row, when weather permitted, and
strove hard in everything to ape all the
manners of the 'upper ten,' in which she
was fully seconded by her eldest born, Miss
Victoria S. De Jobbyns, a rather pretty, but
very insipid girl, who wore her hair frizzed
into her eyes, and had a nose more than
retroussé, for though she was pretty, as we
have said, her features were nevertheless of
the genuine Cockney type.
</p>

<p>
Alison took all her meals in the schoolroom
with the children, and at the early
hours which were directed for them.  She
was never in the drawing-room&mdash;'the
British drawing-room,' that sanctum sacred
to Mrs. De Jobbyns and her 'swell' visitors,
as she called them, and when she thought
it was 'rather the thing' to have afternoon
tea in dragon blue and white crockery on a
beautiful Chippendale table.
</p>

<p>
And so, for thirty pounds per annum,
Alison underwent this life of mortification.
</p>

<p>
'Thirty pound a-year, and her laundry
work, my dear,' as Mrs. De Jobbyns
informed her friend, Mrs. Popkins-Robbynson.
</p>

<p>
'That is very cheap for one evidently so
accomplished,' said the latter.
</p>

<p>
'Very cheap, indeed; but she is such a
good style for the children, you know; and
really I think she must have been some one
of&mdash;of&mdash;well, means once.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'The richly laced under-garments she
sends to the laundry would quite surprise
you, my dear.'
</p>

<p>
'But won't her Scotch haccent spile the
young 'uns?' observed Mr. Popkins-Robbynson.
</p>

<p>
'Not at all; and she seems to get on so
nicely with the servants.  They all adore her.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'My last governess, Miss Smythe-Smythe
was always at war with them.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'They never paid her sufficient deference.
Oh, what a nuisance that woman was; yet
we paid her forty pounds a year&mdash;actually
what we pays the cook, my dear.'
</p>

<p>
To be near his young mistress, to watch
over her, as he thought, and to be able to
see her from time to time, old Archie had
located himself in a humble lodging in
Moscow Road, not far from the square,
where he lived with the strictest frugality,
fearing that a time might come when his
'three hunner pounds,' or what remained of
them, might be of service to <i>her</i>, 'as hained
gear helps weel,' and often, with more
patience than even a lover might have had,
he promenaded the square for hours, watching
for a sight of her at the school-room
windows, or till she came forth with her
pupils to walk in Kensington Gardens&mdash;watching
for her till he in turn was
watched, as one bent on something nefarious,
by the policeman at the corner.
</p>

<p>
And ere long the two little girls began
to wonder who the funny old man was that
so often hovered near them in their walks,
who treated their governess with such
profound deference and devotion, and was
never unprovided with chocolate creams
and so forth for them&mdash;'sweeties for the
bairns,' as he called them.
</p>

<p>
But often Alison sat up in her little white
bed, in her bare and rather comfortless
room, in the darkness of the silent night,
and, looking at the stars, would ask why
she was so lonely in the world now&mdash;she
who was born with the prospect of a very
different state of existence!  Then would
come all her dream-memories of the past,
with those other dreams of what <i>might be</i>,
did fortune prove more kind.  How long it
seemed ago since she had her father to
nurse and Cadbury to shun&mdash;longer still
since she had known the joy of Bevil's love,
and the stolen meetings under the solemn
and whispering beeches of Chilcote.
</p>

<p>
Chilcote was lonely; but how lovely it
seemed to her in memory now!  She even
found herself at times now indulging in the
two conundrums&mdash;the modern pessimist's
speculations&mdash;Is civilisation a failure, and is
life worth living?
</p>

<p>
The monotony of the school-room was
now occasionally broken by visits&mdash;few and
far between, certainly&mdash;of the eldest daughter
of the house, Miss De Jobbyns, who had
returned from a sojourn with some friends
at Hastings&mdash;a young lady rather loud in
tone and fast in manner.  She had early
discovered that Alison was dexterous in the
way of embroidering, and thus kept her
little hands busy, when not otherwise occupied,
in tracing out her monogram and crest&mdash;for
she had that, of course&mdash;in the corners
of handkerchiefs, interspersed with
forget-me-nots, rose-sprays, and fern-leaves.
</p>

<p>
Miss Victoria De Jobbyns (she had originally
been christened Sarah, but that name
was dropped now as vulgar) had from the
first felt an emotion of pique that her little
sisters' governess should be so lady-like, so
perfectly patrician in air and bearing, and,
more than all, so uselessly handsome; for,
of course, she thought, of what use is beauty
to a governess?
</p>

<p>
Her mother's first idea had been, what a
perilous inmate in a house if there had been
a grown-up son; but, apart from her being
a paid dependant, her very loveliness was
an all-sufficient reason for secluding her in
the school-room, and never permitting her
to be seen by guests or visitors, especially
of the male sex.
</p>

<p>
'You are Scotch?' said the young lady,
abruptly and interrogatively, on the occasion
of her first visit.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet you don't look a bit Scotch, or
talk like them either.'
</p>

<p>
Alison smiled as she wondered what the
young lady thought the natives of the North
were like.
</p>

<p>
'Where do your people live&mdash;in the Highlands?'
</p>

<p>
'My family are&mdash;all dead.'
</p>

<p>
'I see you are in mourning&mdash;all dead&mdash;everyone?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Alison, curtly.
</p>

<p>
'How funny!'
</p>

<p>
Alison stared at this peculiar remark.
</p>

<p>
'What was that you were playing when I
came in?' asked her visitor.
</p>

<p>
'A mazurka of Chopin's.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Shopang</i>&mdash;who is he?  And how well
you sing, too.'
</p>

<p>
'I am glad you think so,' replied Alison,
who sometimes accompanied herself on the
old, ill-tuned, and twangling school-room piano.
</p>

<p>
'Ma will be having you to play at her
weekly receptions.'
</p>

<p>
Alison shivered at the bare idea of figuring
thus among such people as were there.
</p>

<p>
'Were you trained for the stage, or was
your father a professional? of course he was.'
</p>

<p>
'He was not' said Alison, sharply, and
at this blunt remark her soft violet eyes
seemed to become hard and blue as a steel
sword-blade; the little colour she had died
out of her face, and she looked ten years
older; but her blunt visitor&mdash;she of the
frizzed, sandy hair, and snub nose&mdash;mistook
the cause of her emotion, and said,
</p>

<p>
'You have had private trouble, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
Alison was silent.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me,' continued the irrepressible Miss
De Jobbyns, 'have you ever been in love?'
</p>

<p>
'In truth&mdash;I have been.'
</p>

<p>
'And your young man&mdash;he is dead, too, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'He I refer to is dead, at least, to me,'
replied Alison, wearily; 'but here come my
pupils, so please to let me resume their tasks.'

One of the chief, if not the only, pleasure
of Alison's life of routine was, on
sunny days, to take her little charges into
Kensington Gardens, and set them by the
margin of the blue Round Pond, and watch
its tiny fleet of toy ships skimming to and
fro, with the hideous, Dutch-looking palace
of Kensington as a background&mdash;a palace,
the rooms of which are only remarkable for
memories of William of Orange (and, let us
add, of Glencoe) and Elizabeth Villiers, the
hideous, one-eyed Countess of Orkney; but
stately, even grand, are the avenues of old
trees that grow thereby.  'How many secrets
have been overheard by these ancient elms
since Heneage Finch built the boundary-fence
of his pleasance!  Could their experience
be set forth for the behoof of modern
lovers, would they be apt,' asks a writer,
'to encourage or to warn?'
</p>

<p>
The old palace is still there as it was
when the home of the Finches, with its
three irregular quadrangles, built of red
brick, ornamented with columns, quoins,
and cornices of indifferent stone, unchanged
as when Solmes Blues mounted guard and
the early Georges swore and blustered in
broken English and guttural German; but
how changed are all its surroundings, for
miles upon miles of streets stretch far to the
westward, southward, and northward of it
now.
</p>

<p>
When James VI., accustomed to old
Edinburgh within its 'Flodden Wall,' was so
startled with the size of the petty London
of his time that, in his famous speech in the
Star Chamber, in 1616, he declared that its
size made it a nuisance to the nation, that
he would have all new edifices pulled down,
and the builders committed to prison, he
could little foresee the London of the days
of steam!
</p>

<p>
And, often as she sat there under the
stately trees, Alison loved to ponder over
the days when the old Court suburb was
remote from London, for in 1750, where
now we find busy Westbourne Grove, stood
a solitary house, called Western Green,
three miles distant from Hyde Park; and
so lately as 1830, on the Bayswater side
of the Gardens, were Kensington Gravel
Pits, facing the Broad Walk, stretching
away to what is now called Bayswater,
which was formerly renowned for the
springs and conduits for which the city was
then indebted for pure water.  It was
famous then for its tea gardens, there called
the Flora, extending the whole length of
Lancaster Gate.
</p>

<p>
So, book in hand, while the children
played near her on the grass, Alison would
sit in Kensington Gardens for hours lost in
reverie, while the bees hummed in the hot
air at the flower-beds near the Serpentine,
and the sun blazed without mercy on the
sheet of shining water that stretched away
towards the Albert Gate; but, when certain
thoughts of the past occurred to her, there
would seem no beauty in that summer
scene, nor warmth even in the sunshine, for
there was a dull, weary, and aching crave
at her heart, with the ever-recurring
question&mdash;Where was Bevil, and why did he not
make an effort to seek her out?
</p>

<p>
She knew not that the only person who
could enlighten him as to her movements&mdash;the
vicar of Chilcote&mdash;had steadily refused
to do so.
</p>

<p>
On such occasions old Archie was generally
hovering about for a sight of her; and,
if he could exchange a word with her, would
steal away to his dingy lodgings 'as happy
as a king,' to use his own phrase; and
muttering&mdash;'The Lord will watch owre
her&mdash;the Lord will watch owre her&mdash;like ilka
blade o' grass that keps its ain drap o' dew.'
</p>

<p>
One day she extended her walk beyond
the boundary of the Gardens, and, crossing
the bridge near the powder magazine,
watched with feverish eagerness the crowds
of fashionables who were gathering in their
thousands there; for it was the 17th of May,
when there was to be a muster of the
Four-in-Hand Club, and she had a strange
presentiment that she should see Bevil
Goring&mdash;one of those presentiments which come
unbidden to the mind, perhaps more often
to the Scottish mind than any other&mdash;why
or how, we know not&mdash;but which seem to
speak of that which is to come as powerfully
as ever did those oracles of old that
whispered through the mist of Delphi, or
by the black doves of Dodona; and she
was not doomed to be&mdash;in one sense at
least&mdash;disappointed.
</p>

<p>
Amid the fast gathering crowds and the
general excitement of the scene she was
careful not to lose sight of her little
charges, whose tiny hands she clasped in
her own, and kept them close by her side.
</p>

<p>
She saw Cadbury ride past, accompanied
by Gaskins his groom; and, while the sight
gave her a kind of shock, she shrank behind
a tree lest he should perceive her, and some
minutes elapsed ere she ventured from her
hiding place.
</p>

<p>
Natheless his peerage, aware of his
plebeian descent and certainly not
distinguished appearance, instead of appearing
fashionably attired like a London park rider,
Cadbury affected the style of a country
gentleman; and on this day&mdash;though a most
indifferent horseman&mdash;he wore Bedford cord
breeches, and black polished boots, an
ordinary cut-away coat buttoned over the
chest, a hat rather low in the crown, and
carried a light hunting whip, affecting the
air of one who flew over his fences 'like a
bird' though not unfrequently he was landed
on one side, while his horse remained on
the other; and he rode over the hounds and
committed many similar unpardonable faults
in the field.
</p>

<p>
At this narrowly escaped rencontre she
felt her colour come and go&mdash;come and
go&mdash;quickly.  The man's appearance brought
brought back with a rush, and vividly, a
host of painful and annoying memories; and
then there was the thousand pounds cheque
sent anonymously and the marble cross so
mysteriously erected at her father's grave.
</p>

<p>
Oh, was she right or was she wrong in
avoiding him?
</p>

<p>
Nowhere in Europe can such a sight be
seen as that presented on such a day beside
the Serpentine when the meet of the
Four-in-Hand Club takes place.  All London
seemed to be looking its brightest and best,
and all London&mdash;at least, the fashionable
world thereof&mdash;seemed to have found some
excuse for being in the vicinity of the
Serpentine Bridge and the powder magazine
which stands thereby.
</p>

<p>
It was May, and the young green trees
were in full foliage, and the parterres of
rhododendrons and azaleas were in bloom; and
gathering there were the beauty and fashion
of the greatest city in the world, with the
best horse flesh, the most accomplished
drivers, and the most perfect drags, with
shining panels and plated harness.
</p>

<p>
On either side of the drive all the hawthorns,
pink and white, were in bloom, loading
the morning air with the perfume of the
almond; and the waters of the Serpentine
were seen at intervals between the flowery
shrubs and long avenues of leafy trees in all
the fresh greenery of May; but as Alison
looked around her she thought of Essilmont
in May&mdash;Essilmont, which too probably she
would never see again, with the pool in the
Ythan where the Black Hound appeared
when one of her race was drowned in it;
where the grey-clad angler loved to linger
by the stream in the silvery morning mist;
where the black gled crowed overhead as
he winged his way across the purple heather,
or the cushet doo cooed with bell-like note
in the pine coppice, and the high antlers of
the stag were seen as he couched amid the
cool and fan-leaved bracken.
</p>

<p>
But the acclamations of the little girls who
clung to her hands or skirts roused Alison
from her reverie, for the procession had
started, and above thirty drags, horsed
magnificently, with splendid silver harness
blazing in the sunshine, were getting into motion,
their drivers&mdash;when not clad in the club
uniform, blue, with gilded buttons&mdash;wearing
accurate morning costume, while the
dresses of the many ladies who crowded the
lofty seats on the roof, were such as only
Regent Street can furnish&mdash;and for beauty,
no other city on earth could have produced
such women as were seen there, in carriages
or on foot.
</p>

<p>
Team after team went past, the German
Ambassador with his bays, the Guards' drag,
with four glossy blacks, the Hussars from
Hounslow, chestnuts, greys, and roans, all
criticised and critically examined by the
onlookers, and surrounded by Hyde Park in
all its glory, the route being taken from the
magazine to Hyde Park corner, thence by
Knightsbridge Barracks, passing the Albert
Memorial, and out by the Queen's Gate,
where the whole passed away like a
phantasmagoria from the eyes of Alison, whose
gaze followed the line of drags like one lost
in a painful dream, after her heart had given
the first bound of bewilderment, on seeing
that the leading coach was driven by Bevil
Goring!
</p>

<p>
She had seen a dashing drag drawn by a
team of beautiful roans, and certainly her
heart beat painfully with joy, amazement,
and then with something of mortification,
when she recognised in the driver thereof,
'tooling along in a most workmanlike
manner,' as a bystander remarked, her <i>fiancé</i>,
Bevil Goring, while on the top seats were
Jerry Wilmot, Tony Dalton, young Fleming,
and others of the Rifles, with Laura, and
several ladies, some of whom were seated
close behind Goring, and in animated
conversation with him, one of them apparently a
rather flirty party, who insisted on shading
his eyes sometimes with her scarlet silk
parasol.
</p>

<p>
She again shrank behind a tree, as she
had done when Cadbury came in sight.  Her
gaze, and her heart too, followed the gay
drag with its roans and brilliant party going
away to luncheon, no doubt at Muswell Hill,
and she watched it until it disappeared.
</p>

<p>
How she got through the remainder of
the day in the dull school-room on the attic
floor in Pembridge Square, she scarcely
knew; but the next was considerably
advanced before she saw an account of the
coaching meet in a fashionable paper, and
read that 'Captain Goring of the Rifles'
drag and team were considered by eminent
connoisseurs as the most perfect in the park.'  A
little further on she saw that at his rooms
in Piccadilly he had, after the meet,
entertained a number of the club at dinner,
with many persons of distinction, including
H.R.H. the F.M. commanding, and one or
two foreign ambassadors.
</p>

<p>
His drag and team!  What a change was
here!  Poor Alison was indeed sorely
bewildered; but on reflection the change failed
to give her joy.  Here were evidences of
great and sudden wealth, and yet he made
no effort to discover her.  And those ladies
on the drag, who were they; and who was
she who seemed so familiar with him, and
to whose playful remarks he stooped to
listen from time to time?
</p>

<p>
Alas! it seemed as if his neglect of her
was quite accounted for now.  She
suppressed a great desire to sob aloud, and
half drew her engagement ring from her
finger.  Then, with true superstition of the
heart, she carefully replaced it, as she did a
locket which contained his likeness, and
which she wore in the breast of her dress;
but the episode of that day and all it vaguely
suggested added sorely to the already sufficient
bitterness of the poor girl's governess life.
</p>

<p>
She knew not that though, in accordance
with his recently-acquired wealth and position,
his own tastes, and the wishes of friends,
Bevil had started a drag and joined the
Four-in-Hand Club, he had been baffled
resolutely more than once in his efforts to
trace her by the well-meaning vicar of
Chilcote, and that he was in perpetual anxiety
to discover her, and was trusting to hope
that her father's death on one hand and his
own ample means had removed the barrier
that the former had raised between them.
</p>

<p>
It is the fate of true love apparently
never to run like a railway.  'But why
that proverbial asperity should be confined
to what is true we are unable to say,' writes
a novelist, adding, 'For our own part, that
eternal smoothness has but little charm;
and the ripple which reflects sunshine and
shade, bright gleams and darkening clouds
in love as in Nature, gives brightness and
variety to the prosiest poetry in the world.'
</p>

<p>
But doubtless Goring and Alison Cheyne
were beginning to think that they had
endured enough of the darkening clouds that
seemed as yet without a silver lining.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
HUMILIATION.
</h3>

<p>
Had Goring indeed forgotten or ceased
to love her?  This was the ever-recurring
question in the mind of Alison
now, and she recalled the lines of the
Spanish song, <i>Vanse mis amores</i>, as
applicable to herself:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'How could I bear&mdash;how bear disdain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who not the slightest favour ever<br>
  Received without a blush of pain;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could I bear disdain?  O, never!<br>
  One hour of absence, swift and brief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not bear&mdash;how should I bear<br>
  A long and tedious age of grief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An age of grief, of gloom and fear?<br>
  O!  I shall die without relief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am young, and&mdash;O, sincere.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
If Goring was, as she thought bitterly
and repiningly, remiss in attempting to trace
her or not caring to do so, as her heart at
times began to forebode, she certainly would
not and could not throw herself in his way;
she could but wait and hope, suffer and endure.
</p>

<p>
But one day she had an unexpected
annoyance to encounter.
</p>

<p>
While the two little girls with the fantastic
names, Irene and Iseulte, played on the
grass near her in Kensington Gardens, seated
under the shadow of the trees, she was
reading&mdash;or trying to read, for her mind was
ever preoccupied&mdash;a railway volume, she
became conscious that a man was hovering
near, indeed, hanging over her.  She looked
up and instantly recognized Sir Jasper
Dehorsey&mdash;or Captain Smith, as she supposed
him to be&mdash;regarding her with his calm and
insolent though admiring and insoucient
smile.  He lifted his hat, and said, with a bow,
</p>

<p>
'I knew I was not mistaken; there could
not be another like my little runaway of
Antwerp.'
</p>

<p>
Alison blushed scarlet with intense annoyance
and then grew pale with alarm, she
felt herself so friendless and alone.  Finding
her silent he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'We have met before&mdash;you remember me, I hope?'
</p>

<p>
'Sir&mdash;I have no wish to remember you,
and still less to renew the acquaintance,'
said Alison, quitting her seat.
</p>

<p>
'Now, that's too bad,' said Dehorsey,
deliberately barring her way; 'too bad indeed.
If my admiration of you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Please to remember that I cannot listen
to your insolence.  These children to whom
I am governess&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Governess&mdash;you&mdash;here is a game!' said
he, mockingly.  'Ahoi, girls&mdash;run after this,
find it and keep it?'
</p>

<p>
Taking a crown piece from his purse he
spun it along the grass to some distance,
and the girls rushed after it to search for and
find it, a task of some difficulty.
</p>

<p>
'Sir, sir,' said Alison, tremulous with
indignation, 'you ought not to have done
that.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'I am the governess of these girls, and
responsible for them.'
</p>

<p>
'Absurd&mdash;a governess, you!  One might
as well expect to see a queen or a professional
beauty filling the post.  Clever this
governess dodge of yours,' he continued, with a
kind of insolence peculiar to himself.  'I
suppose these girls are your nieces&mdash;little
decoy ducklings to play propriety?  And how
is our mutual friend, old Cad&mdash;I mean Lord
Cadbury?  Seen him lately?  No answer?
Quarrelled, I suppose&mdash;these things never
last long; but you are as charming as ever.
How bad of you to leave me as you did that
night in the Café au Progrès!'
</p>

<p>
Alison called the children to her side and
walked away.  There was in her whole air
and manner a conscious dignity that might
have quieted the presumptuous coxcomb and
<i>roué</i> who dared to address her, while
affliction had touched her features with
something in expression that was beyond even
beauty; but Dehorsey was one of those men
who had a total disbelief in any feminine
purity.
</p>

<p>
'Where do you live, little one?' he asked,
while deliberately following her.
</p>

<p>
Alison made no reply, but looked round
to see if Archie was near.  He was in sight,
but an appeal to him just then would have
been unwise, for, old though he was, Dehorsey
would have felt the full weight of his
walking staff.
</p>

<p>
'How dare you, coward that you are, to
molest me thus!' exclaimed Alison.
</p>

<p>
'A rough word from such lips as yours,'
he said, mockingly, but changing colour
nevertheless; 'but as an old friend&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Friend!'
</p>

<p>
'Votre pardon, mademoiselle&mdash;acquaintance then.'
</p>

<p>
Alison quitted the Gardens in haste, and
hurried home with her two charges; and
she was afterwards compelled to relinquish
promenading there, one of her chief pleasures,
as Dehorsey was always on the watch
for her, and more than once had followed
her at a little distance to the door of the
house in Pembridge Square.
</p>

<p>
She was thus obliged to remain more
indoors than she was wont to do; and, to
add to her annoyance there, she was
considerably afflicted by much more than she
relished of the society of the loud and fast
Miss De Jobbyns; for that young lady had
recently found an admirer, or&mdash;as she
confidently alleged&mdash;a lover, and in her vanity
and exultation was never weary of expatiating
to Alison on his merits and wealth, his
looks, his phrases, his dress, the
'button-holes' she made for him, and how she and
her mamma contrived to waylay him in the
park or the Row and elsewhere, to all of
which Alison's listened wearily and without
interest, not even caring to inquire his
name.
</p>

<p>
She had her own sad thoughts of love,
and they were enough for her.
</p>

<p>
'I should like you to see him when he
comes to mamma's weekly reception,'
continued the young lady, as she frizzed up
her hair and practised <i>œillades</i> at herself in
Alison's little mirror, 'but as a rule mamma
never intrudes a governess on friends&mdash;excuse
me saying so.'
</p>

<p>
'I am aware of that,' replied Alison,
softly, and heedless of the cutting rudeness
of the speech.
</p>

<p>
'Since Miss Smythe-Smythe was here,
she fancies that governesses require to be
snubbed.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'As a matter of principle, I suppose; but,
upon my soul, I think it is rather hard upon
you,' continued this slangy young person.
'We met him at Mr. Taype the lawyer's
house, in Sussex Gardens, and, as he is rich,
mamma fastened on him at once for me,
don't you know; oh, isn't it fun?'
</p>

<p>
'Are you engaged then?' asked Alison,
when Miss De Jobbyns had expatiated on
the subject for more than half an hour.
</p>

<p>
'Engaged&mdash;oh, no&mdash;not exactly yet&mdash;but
it is only a matter of time.  He showed
a great desire to cultivate our family; or
rather mamma determined to cultivate him.
But, hang it all!  He is very shy for an
officer, and leaves me to do the spooning
actually.'
</p>

<p>
'He is in the army then?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and hangs out at Aldershot.'
</p>

<p>
Alison felt her colour change at the name
of that locality; but she only said,
</p>

<p>
'Miss De Jobbyns, you should not use
the fast phrases you do.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, ma uses them; ma always does.'
</p>

<p>
She did not add, that which perhaps she
did not know, that her 'ma' had whilom
been most accomplished in 'sherry-glass
flirtations' while behind the bar at the
'Black Swan.'
</p>

<p>
'Isn't spoon English?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'It is slang.'
</p>

<p>
'Is it?  Well, if the verb "to spoon" is
slang, I like it&mdash;that is all!  But I wish I
could flirt.'
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose?'
</p>

<p>
'To draw him on.  But simply I can't
do it, he is so stand-off in his manner.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'It is not my <i>forte</i>; I wish it was.  There
is Miss Le Robbynson, she can flirt with a
dozen of men at once, and even make them
quarrel about her.'
</p>

<p>
'But men as a rule dislike flirts, and
don't marry them; and flirting is pretending
to care for a person when you don't.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah; but I care a great deal for this
fellow.'
</p>

<p>
'Fellow?' queried Alison, on whose delicate
ear this girl's phraseology jarred sorely.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my military beau?'
</p>

<p>
'You should not adopt this style.'
</p>

<p>
'You are not my governess!' retorted
Miss De Jobbyns, with some asperity.
</p>

<p>
'Some day, no doubt, I shall see your
intended.'
</p>

<p>
The daughter of the house blushed with
pleasure at the phrase; but thought that,
with a governess so undeniably handsome,
it might be better that no meeting took
place as yet.  Suddenly she said,
</p>

<p>
'You have some fellow's photo that you
wear at your neck; you have it on now,'
she added, making a clutch at a ribbon
which encircled the slender throat of Alison,
who instinctively drew back and placed a
hand upon her bosom.
</p>

<p>
'Some fellow's photo!&mdash;how <i>can</i> you use
such a style of language?' she asked,
haughtily.
</p>

<p>
'I have told you before that you are not
my governess, and I won't be lectured by
you; but as for the photo&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'It is not a photo I wear to-day.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'An ornament which I wear because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?' asked Miss De Jobbyns, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'It is the anniversary of papa's birth.'
</p>

<p>
'And you won't show it to me?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not said so,' replied Alison,
gently, as she drew up the object from her
bosom.  It was her father's badge, and the
badge of his father before him, as a baronet
of Nova Scotia&mdash;a gold oval species of
medal, bearing in a scutcheon, <i>argent</i>, a
St. Andrew's cross, <i>azure</i>, with thereon an
inscutcheon of the royal arms of Scotland,
with an Imperial crown, and the motto of
Henry, Duke of Rothesay, '<i>Fax mentis
honestœ gloria</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Miss De Jobbyns, who had never seen
anything of the kind before, surveyed it
with equal wonder and admiration.
</p>

<p>
'What a funny thing!  I would so like
to wear it at a ball to-night,' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me,' replied Alison, as she replaced
it in her bosom, 'but I cannot lend it.'
</p>

<p>
'How greedy of you!  Then you will
sell it, perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sell it!</i>' repeated Alison, with an
inflection of voice that struck even the dull ear
of the soap-boiler's daughter.  'Not for
worlds!'
</p>

<p>
'I thought you said that your father was
dead.'
</p>

<p>
'He is dead.'
</p>

<p>
'Then who is that queer-looking old
Scotsman whom Irene and Iseulte see
speaking to you sometimes?'
</p>

<p>
'He was my father's faithful valet, and is
now my faithful friend,' replied Alison, with
mingled hauteur and emotion.
</p>

<p>
'Dear me! how romantic&mdash;how funny!
But I suppose you will have no place now
to spend your holidays in?'
</p>

<p>
'None,' sighed Alison, who had never
thought of them till then, and she looked
round the bare, bleak school-room, the
scene of her daily toil, and where nearly
all her time was passed now; but just then
the carriage was announced, and she was
relieved of the oppressive society of the
somewhat irrepressible Miss Victoria De
Jobbyns.
</p>

<p>
If the children talked thus of poor old
Archie Auchindoir, they might speak of the
insolent 'Captain Smith.'  Thus she might
lose her situation and be again cast on the
world.  Oh, how tempest-tossed was her
poor little heart!
</p>

<p>
The perfect, self-posed, and ladylike
manner of Alison was to a certain extent
lost upon the rather rough, pampered, and
hoydenish damsel who had just driven off
to the Row to meet her admirer, no doubt,
and who saw in her only a paid dependant,
whom her mother might discard like one of
the housemaids at an hour's notice or less.
Her sweet nature, her natural lightness and
cheerfulness, her readiness and wish to
oblige, yet never intrusively in any way, were
all lost on the coarse natures of those among
whom her evil fortune had cast her.
</p>

<p>
She was glad that on this particular day,
inspired by filial reverence, she had substituted
the relic of her father for the locket
which contained the photo of Bevil Goring,
whose face she would have shrunk from
subjecting to the off-hand criticism of the
young lady who had just left her; and she
was not without a stronger fear that the
military lover of Miss De Jobbyns&mdash;if lover
he was&mdash;was the <i>roué</i> Dehorsey, who now
haunted Kensington Gardens and Pembridge
Square, though 'Captain Smith' seemed
scarcely the kind of man to be captivated
by the soap-boiler's daughter.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
MISS DE JOBBYNS' ADMIRER.
</h3>

<p>
'You will be good enough to keep the
children quiet and amused this evening,
Miss Cheyne,' said Mrs. De Jobbyns,
'as we have company coming to dinner.
Also have them nicely dressed, as they may
be sent for to dessert or to the drawing-room.'
</p>

<p>
Being now used to be spoken to in this
style, Alison merely bowed, on which
Mrs. De Jobbyns said, sharply,
</p>

<p>
'You heard me, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; you certainly spoke loud enough.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. De Jobbyns frowned.  She would
have liked her to add 'ma'am,' like any
other paid dependant; but Alison, of course,
never thought of such a thing.
</p>

<p>
'You may withdraw now, Miss Cheyne,'
said the lady, with an assumption of would-be
dignity that sat rather absurdly on the
whilome dispenser of glasses of gin and
bitters and pints of stout at the bar of the
'Black Swan.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Miss Cheyne, I wonder when the
wedding is to be!' exclaimed little Irene
when Alison returned to the school-room.
</p>

<p>
'Whose wedding, dear?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Vic.'s&mdash;don't you know she is
going to be married to that rich military
swell?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, fie, Irene&mdash;you must not use such
terms!'
</p>

<p>
'Why not?  I heard cook call him so
when she told the tablemaid, and said we
two girls would be bridesmaids.'
</p>

<p>
Intent on a book she had procured&mdash;by
the way, save photographic albums in which
the De Jobbyns family were reproduced
endlessly, there were no books in the
house&mdash;Alison thought no more of the
matter; but when evening was drawing on
she heard the soft rustle of a long silken
skirt, as Miss De Jobbyns, arrayed for
conquest, swept in, wearing a really beautiful
costume of dark blue velvet and light blue
silk, smothered with cream-tinted lace.
</p>

<p>
'He is coming&mdash;he is coming to dinner&mdash;mamma
got him to promise that he would,
at last!' exclaimed the young lady, pirouetting
about in the extravagance of her joy.
'Tell me how you like my dress?'
</p>

<p>
'It is indeed exquisite&mdash;in material,'
replied Alison, who of course had dined in
the school-room with her pupils at one
o'clock, and felt little or no interest to learn
that Miss Victoria's lover, or admirer, was
coming to a little dinner <i>en famille</i> at
seven p.m.
</p>

<p>
'He will soon be here&mdash;how do you think
I look?' she asked for the third or fourth
time.
</p>

<p>
As Alison's delicate fingers were adjusting
some parts of the lace, the sharp eyes
of Miss De Jobbyns observed&mdash;as they had
often done before&mdash;the ring, the engagement
ring, which the former had received
from her lover, under the whispering beeches,
one evening.
</p>

<p>
'It is very beautiful, and must be valuable,'
said Miss De Jobbyns, examining it closely.
</p>

<p>
'It is valuable.'
</p>

<p>
'Too much so, I think, for&mdash;for one
teaching to wear.'
</p>

<p>
'When it was given to me, teaching was
not thought of,' said Alison, in a low, sad
voice.
</p>

<p>
'I have no end of lovely rings; but,'
urged the girl, who was by nature covetous,
'you might lend it to me, just for to-night,
though you wouldn't lend that funny ornament
for the Le Robbynson's ball.'
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me,' replied Alison, coldly, 'it
never leaves my finger.'
</p>

<p>
'Not even when you wash your hands?'
</p>

<p>
'Not even then.'
</p>

<p>
'You will spoil these beautiful stones.'
</p>

<p>
'It shall never be seen on another hand
while I live.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed,' sneered Miss De Jobbyns;
'and thereby hangs a tale, I suppose.  Upon
my Sam you are very romantic!  Of course
you got it from the fellow whose photo you
wear, but will let no one see?'
</p>

<p>
Alison made no reply, but her colour
came and went with annoyance at the girl's
brusquerie; and the latter began to chant
the praises of her admirer, a subject of
which her listener was utterly weary.
</p>

<p>
'He has we don't know how many thousands
a year&mdash;think of that; oh my!  Talking
of love, I heard him say laughingly to
mamma, who was chaffing him on the subject,
that he would not be in love with anyone again.'
</p>

<p>
'And what of that?'
</p>

<p>
'He meant, of course, with anyone again
but me.'
</p>

<p>
'How do you construe his remark thus?'
</p>

<p>
'Because his eyes met mine as he said so;
and I do hope I blushed&mdash;I am sure I did.'
</p>

<p>
'And he is rich, you say?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, rich enough to satisfy even mamma.'
</p>

<p>
'That is fortunate,' replied Alison, with a
sigh, as she recalled her father's bitter
opposition to her own engagement, and all the
wiles and worry of Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
'Fortunate indeed; but there is about Bevil&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'BEVIL!' exclaimed Alison, startled by
the uncommon name.
</p>

<p>
'Don't snap me up so!  Yes, Bevil is
his name&mdash;sweetly pretty I think it&mdash;Bevil
Goring.'
</p>

<p>
'And he is rich, you say?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; has twenty or thirty thousand a
year at least.'
</p>

<p>
It cannot be the same, though the conjunction
of name is very singular, said Alison
in her agitated heart.
</p>

<p>
'Is he a merchant,' she asked, 'a city man?'
</p>

<p>
'City be hanged!' responded this
impulsive young woman.  'He is an officer&mdash;a
Captain in the Rifle Brigade, and, when
not in town, hangs out at Aldershot.  But
there is a carriage; the people are arriving,
and I must be off.'
</p>

<p>
She quickly withdrew, leaving Alison pale
as a corpse, trembling in every limb, and
rooted to the spot, propping herself by a
hand on the table, till she sank into a chair,
oblivious of the wonder with which the two
little girls regarded her sudden, and, to
them, unaccountable emotion.
</p>

<p>
For some time her thoughts were terrible.
She recalled the drag alleged by the public
prints to be Goring's&mdash;the entertainment,
given even to royalty, at 'his rooms in
Piccadilly,' all evidences of wealth that must
have come to him since the time she was
decoyed to the Continent, and in the fact
of that wealth&mdash;the absence of which was
the cause of her father's hostility to the last
hour of his life&mdash;this girl's remarks now
confirmed her!
</p>

<p>
That Bevil Goring could love or even
admire such a girl&mdash;a man so refined and
delicate in taste and ideas&mdash;she never for a
moment imagined; but what did the whole
situation and that girl's boastful allegations
mean?  How came he to know such people,
despite their great wealth, and permit
them to cultivate his acquaintance?  Yet
matters seemed to have progressed so far
that even the servants were canvassing the
prospects of a <i>wedding</i>!
</p>

<p>
More than all, why, oh why had he never
attempted to discover her, to trace her out,
in these her days of poverty and sore trial!
</p>

<p>
The magnitude and the multitude of her
thoughts overwhelmed her; among these
were emotions of sharp but just pride, keen
disappointment, bitterest doubt, and agonising
mortification; but her tears&mdash;usually so
ready to flow&mdash;came not to relieve her
now, and she was only roused from a kind
of feverish stupefaction by the entrance of
a servant to light the candles, and conduct
'the young ladies downstairs to dessert,' an
invitation to which they responded with
instant alacrity.
</p>

<p>
Stooping over the stair-bannister, she
heard his voice once or twice as the male
guests filed off to the drawing-room after
the ladies, and it thrilled through her heart.
A choking lump rose in her throat, but
still not a tear would come.
</p>

<p>
After a time she was roused by some one
addressing her.  It was a servant, by nature
saucy, under-bred, illiterate, and disposed
to be impertinent in general when she could
be so with impunity.
</p>

<p>
'Were you addressing me?' asked Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; the missus says as you are to tittivate
yourself a bit and come down to the
drawing-room.'
</p>

<p>
'I am to&mdash;<i>what</i>?' asked Alison, sharply&mdash;for
her at least.
</p>

<p>
'Tittivate yourself&mdash;it is Henglish; but,
bein' Scotch, perhaps you don't know what
it means.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not going to the&mdash;drawing-room
to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'You won't obey the missus?' exclaimed
the servant, aghast.
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not in this instance.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't you know your place?  You are
honly a guv'ness, and guv'nesses ain't ladies,
whatever they may think.'
</p>

<p>
'What are they?'
</p>

<p>
'Mock ones.'
</p>

<p>
'Leave the room instantly&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Or what?' asked the girl, sharply.
</p>

<p>
'I'll get you turned out of the house.'
</p>

<p>
The girl withdrew uttering as Parthian
shots some remarks about 'hupstarts
hordering their betters about.'
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Miss De Jobbyns, with
some irritation of manner, appeared to
prefer the same request, adding that she was
wanted for a hand at whist.
</p>

<p>
'To come down to play whist?  Is not
this an unusual condescension?' asked Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' was the cool response; 'ma thinks
it part of your duty to make yourself
generally useful; and, I suppose, you can play
whist?'
</p>

<p>
The girl was too underbred to be aware
how heartless was the <i>sang froid</i>, in which
she suggested, or commanded, that Alison
should make herself useful.
</p>

<p>
'I would rather be excused.'
</p>

<p>
'But ma says you must!'
</p>

<p>
'Must&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'A hand is wanted at the whist table,
and I want Bevil at the piano, all to myself.'
</p>

<p>
'It is utterly impossible.  I have a headache,'
replied Alison, goaded to desperation.
</p>

<p>
'Bother your headache!' was the elegant
response; 'try sal volatile, Rimmel's
vinegar, anything, but come.'
</p>

<p>
However, Alison remained inflexible, and
so far from making herself 'useful' to either
Mrs. De Jobbyns and her daughter, by
appearing in their circle downstairs, she
retired to bed&mdash;to think and weep&mdash;but not
to sleep.
</p>

<p>
The vicar of Chilcote was, she knew, in
town, and to him she would appeal to
procure her another home, where she would
hear the name of Bevil Goring no more!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
THE FORECLOSURE EFFECTED.
</h3>

<p>
While Dalton, under Laura's care and
nursing, had been fast recovering
health and strength, on leave of absence, at
Chilcote Grange; and Jerry Wilmot, though
less tenderly cared for at Wilmothurst,
surrounded as he was then by every luxury
and comfort still, was also fast learning to
forget all he had endured in Ashanti, and
all the natural buoyancy of his spirits was
returning, Lady Julia was as full of
unspeakable animosity at Mr. Chevenix as the
languid character of her aristocratic nature
would permit her to be.
</p>

<p>
A regular breach had replaced the cool
indifference with which she had viewed that
personage.  In the profundity of his
plebeian insolence he had at last taken full
measures to obtain the interest on his
mortgages, and more, he had foreclosed them,
and ruin now awaited the house of Wilmot!
</p>

<p>
And again and again, while tenderly
carressing Flossie, or having her long tresses
brushed out by Mademoiselle Florine, she
languidly bewailed to Cousin Emily, or to
Jerry, who lingered near her with the cigar
in hand he dared not light in her presence,
that 'the artful pillager of the Wilmot
estates would drive her to a beggar's grave
in a foreign land.'
</p>

<p>
Though Jerry thought life was too short
'for all this sort of thing,' and was making
up his mind to 'cut the whole thing' and go
to India, he was still on friendly terms with
old Mr. Chevenix, but nevertheless was
greatly ruffled by stories that reached him of
Lord Twiseldown's attention to Bella, and
was once, as he phrased it, 'awfully cut up,'
when coming upon them riding together
without even a groom in attendance, and
nearly overtook them in a green lane&mdash;yea,
would have done so, had he not timely
drawn the bridle of his own horse.
</p>

<p>
They had been laughing and talking
amicably&mdash;certainly more like friends, it would
seem, than lovers, as gossip averred them to
be; and with aching heart, and eager and
admiring eyes, poor Jerry Wilmot&mdash;poor in
more ways than one, for he was a ruined
man now&mdash;observed the air and bearing of
the handsome girl, in her dark blue riding
habit&mdash;a costume so fitted for the display of
every womanly grace&mdash;while from her slender
waist she moved with every movement
of her horse, the very action of which
seemed to assert that he was proud of having
such a rider.
</p>

<p>
Still more was Jerry 'cut up' and then
perplexed when, soon after, he met
Mr. Chevenix, who, with a twinkle in his
eye&mdash;whether of pride or mischief the said Jerry
failed to detect&mdash;informed him, somewhat
unnecessarily as he thought, that Lord
Twiseldown had proposed to Bella.
</p>

<p>
'Proposed!' repeated Jerry, in a rather
breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And when does the&mdash;the marriage come off?'
</p>

<p>
'It won't come off at all.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'She has refused him.'
</p>

<p>
'Refused him!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; odd, isn't it?  Can't make Bella
out at all,' replied Mr. Chevenix, as he
nodded, smiled, and trotted away on his cob.
</p>

<p>
Jerry was, we say, perplexed on hearing
of this.  Bella's refusal of Twiseldown's hand
delighted him greatly, but was it born of
regard for himself or regard for someone else?
He had not gone near her for some time
past, and knew not how many might have
been hovering about her, now that, with all
her beauty and brilliance apart, she was
known as the virtual heiress of Wilmothurst.
</p>

<p>
It filled him with many thoughts that were
difficult of arrangement and of analysis.  He
resolved to pay her a farewell visit anyway,
and told his lady mother that he would do so.
</p>

<p>
'That girl again!' said Lady Julia, as he
rode off.  'I did not think that he had
actually involved himself with her.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor has he, perhaps, auntie,' sighed
Cousin Emily, though her heart made her
suspect otherwise.
</p>

<p>
'I believe Jerry to be, like many young
men of the present day,' resumed Lady Julia,
still obtuse as to the new situation, 'one
of those who think they can&mdash;especially with
a girl of her position in society&mdash;go to the
utmost confines of love-making&mdash;can look,
say, and do what they please, and yet do
and say nothing that will quite compromise
them, or involve their honour; and girls
such as the Chevenix quite understand the
matter.  But that there should be more in
it passes my comprehension, and yours too,
darling Flossie,' she added, taking the cur
out of its mother-of-pearl basket and kissing
its nose tenderly.
</p>

<p>
She spoke, as usual, languidly and softly,
for she was ever one of those who deem that
'feeling, or any betrayal of it, is a sure sign
of an ill-bred person'&mdash;bad form, in short.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Jerry was <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Bella
Chevenix in her pretty little drawing-room
overlooking the ivy-clad church and the
village green.
</p>

<p>
Jerry was rather grave, for Bella had
been piqued by his absence, and received
him, he thought, rather coldly, which led
him to fear there 'was some other fellow in
the field;' but anon Bella began to rally him,
for she could not but remember that the
letter he had written on the night before
Coomassie was entered, amounted quite to a
declaration.
</p>

<p>
'I begin to sicken of the world and all
its bitterness, Bella,' said he, a little
irrelevantly, on which she sang, softly,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh, what shall I be at fifty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am then alive,<br>
  If I find the world so bitter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am barely twenty-five?'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'I wonder if you will be so merry when
we meet again, years hence, if ever,' said
Jerry, almost angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Years hence&mdash;what do you mean, Jerry&mdash;for
I must call you Jerry as of old, if you
adopt this tone?' said she, regarding his
now grave face attentively.
</p>

<p>
'I go to the Horse Guards to-morrow to
arrange about an exchange for India.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask&mdash;when you know that I am
a ruined and beggared man?'
</p>

<p>
He was looking doggedly out of the window,
and did not see how her sensitive lips
quivered, and how her shapely bodice was
heaving with the painful pulsations of her
warm and affectionate heart; for Bella&mdash;impulsive
Bella&mdash;felt that if she said only a
little more she must break down altogether;
and the muscles of her slender throat ached
with the efforts she made to keep back her
desire to weep.
</p>

<p>
'Ruined&mdash;Jerry&mdash;you?' she said, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'You know how, and why; the past is
over&mdash;at an end, and for ever; but do
think of me kindly, Bella, when I am far
away from you&mdash;for my own kindred are
few and cold&mdash;yea, seem to have little heart
for me.'
</p>

<p>
'Jerry, dear Jerry,' said the girl, in a low
voice, 'ere this, I thought you would have
asked me to marry&mdash;to&mdash;to marry you.'
</p>

<p>
'I dared not, Bella.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Lest you might misunderstand me.'
</p>

<p>
'But you&mdash;you love me?'
</p>

<p>
'God alone knows how well!'
</p>

<p>
'Then, Jerry, will <i>you</i> marry me?' she
said, while her sweet voice sank into a
pleading whisper; 'I have always loved you.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry caught her wildly in his arms.
</p>

<p>
'Bella&mdash;my wife&mdash;my own little wife at
last!' exclaimed Jerry, in a rather broken
voice, as they kissed each other solemnly
and passionately, for all doubts between
them were ended now.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Bella darling,' said Jerry, after
sundry incoherences had been indulged in,
'though far, far away from you, I often
dreamed of such an hour as this&mdash;for I was
always with you in the spirit.'
</p>

<p>
'I would rather have had you, as I have
you now, you dear, provoking old Jerry, in
the flesh,' replied Bella, with one of her
arch and waggish smiles.  'It is much more
satisfactory.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So Wilmothurst would return to the old
line again, in all its vast extent of fertile
acreage, and with the latter would come a
bride second to none in brilliance and beauty
that had ever come there before, though
not&mdash;like haughty Lady Julia, the daughter of
ever so many earls&mdash;but of a hale, stout,
and warm-hearted old fellow, who loved
Jerry as his own son&mdash;though, sooth to say,
we fear he will never be able to abide his
mother, who eventually took up her abode,
in sullen and stately grandeur, with Cousin
Emily, at the restored Dower House in
Langley Park.
</p>

<p>
So Jerry did not go up to the Horse
Guards after all, but quietly and rapidly set
about the arrangements for his marriage,
which was very soon to come about; and,
meanwhile, as may be supposed, he spent
every spare hour&mdash;and he had a good many
of them&mdash;with Bella.
</p>

<p>
'The joy of my life is a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
you, dearest Bella,' said Jerry, as he lay on
the grass at her feet one evening smoking
his brier-root.  'My lady mother's manner
is so cold and stately that she quite thrusts
all a poor fellow's heart back upon himself.
By Jove, you should have seen her mode
of welcoming me home after our shindy in
Ashanti!  I would have preferred less
etiquette and more love; some of the
kissing and clinging some of our poor fellows,
like Tony Dalton, received on the day we
landed at Portsmouth.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Jerry! you will never want for
kisses now,' said Bella, laughingly.
</p>

<p>
'By-the-by, I have a letter from Goring,
who is again in town, and cutting quite a
figure, I hear, in the world of fashion.'
</p>

<p>
'Has he heard aught yet of Miss Cheyne,
poor girl?' asked Bella, who naturally took
a deep interest in all love affairs, especially
just then.
</p>

<p>
'He says that he has not.  Here is his
epistle; but that he is bored to death by a
soap-boiler's widow and her daughter, an
absurd couple, whom, for his sins, he met
at the house of Taype, his solicitor, and
who have made a dead set at him&mdash;waylay
him in the park with their carriage, haunt
the vicinity of his club, and pester him with
invitations.
</p>

<p>
'"They are shameless in their mode of
teasing me, these devilish women," he
continues, "and seem to possess the power of
ubiquity, and bid fair to run me to earth.
I must either cut them or hook it, and
come back to the camp."  Only fancy,
Bella, what odd creatures they must be.'
</p>

<p>
'But everyone has not the wealth and
handsome person of Captain Goring.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and Bevil is one of the right good
sort.'
</p>

<p>
So there were two sides to the picture
drawn by the fervid fancy or vanity of Miss
Victoria De Jobbyns; and Alison Cheyne,
had she known all, need not have wept so
bitterly far into the hours of the night, as
related.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
HOMELESS.
</h3>

<p>
With Alison events were fated to follow
each other fast now.
</p>

<p>
On the day subsequent to the dinner-party
at Pembridge Square she felt too ill
to leave her bed till the afternoon was well
advanced.  She was, however, visited by
Miss De Jobbyns, who gave her a very
inflated account of Goring's attentions to
herself, how she completely 'snuffed out the
three Le Robbynson girls,' and gave him
credit for many flattering, and certainly
peculiar, utterances that Alison thought
very unlike the Goring that she knew.
Still she was painfully uncertain what to
think, and was very glad when her garrulous
visitor, after readjusting her frizzled
hair in the mirror and inspecting the few
trifles that lay on the toilet-table, took her
departure.
</p>

<p>
Alison, we have said, could not throw
herself in Goring's way; her pride and
delicacy, all love apart, revolted at the
idea and she now actually trembled lest
the chance mention of her not very common
name by any of the De Jobbyns' family
might lead to the discovery of her identity
in her present humble position.
</p>

<p>
And now a letter, on the envelope of
which a coronet figured, was, after being
long inspected, and the cause of much
surmise by Mrs. and Miss De Jobbyns, handed
to her by a servant.  She opened it and
read.  It would seem that, though Bevil
Goring had failed to obtain from the vicar
of Chilcote the London address of Alison
and a clue to her circumstances, the 'Right
Honourable Lord Cadbury' had succeeded
in obtaining both, in virtue of his rank, we
presume; and the result was this letter,
most subtily and cunningly worded, and
dated not from his club or from Cadbury
Court, but from the villa of his 'lady friend'
at St. John's Wood, offering her a home
there, and containing what she conceived at
first to be another offer of marriage; but, on
re-reading it, the real meaning of and nature
of the document came before her, in all its
insulting form and truth, as it fell from her
hand ere she tore it into minute fragments
with trembling fingers.  She grew deadly
pale, but her lips became firm and set; her
bosom heaved, and all the purity of her
nature, her pride of old position and race,
<i>l'esprit de famille</i> which her father had
inculcated rose within her, she covered her
face with her hands as if to thrust back her
tears, and exclaimed, in a low voice,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, papa!  It wanted but this
insult to complete the humiliation of my
life!'
</p>

<p>
So the parvenu peer sought&mdash;but in vain&mdash;to
put a keystone to the edifice of his
own innate rascality.
</p>

<p>
At last she rose from her bed and proceeded
to dress herself with the intention of
visiting the vicar without delay to beseech
him to find her another home; but&mdash;on
looking about her toilet-table, where she
had certainly left it over night&mdash;she missed
her locket&mdash;the locket with the likeness of
Bevil in it!
</p>

<p>
She instituted a strict if hurried search
over all her little room, but no trace of it
could be found.
</p>

<p>
The servant who had brought breakfast
to her on a covered salver had never
approached the toilet-table she was certain;
but Miss De Jobbyns had, as she remembered,
lingered before the mirror, and trifled
with the little etceteras that lay thereby.
</p>

<p>
Could she be the abstractor, the delinquent,
the thief?
</p>

<p>
Impossible!  Yet Alison had barely
completed attiring herself for the street,
with the intention of asking permission to
go out for a little time, when a maid appeared,
sent by Mrs. De Jobbyns, to request her
presence in the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
'In the drawing-room,' thought Alison;
'what does that import?'
</p>

<p>
On entering, the first object that caught
her eye was her locket in that lady's hand,
and she had a perfect conviction that the
latter and her daughter were inflamed with
keen resentment.
</p>

<p>
'Jealousy,' we are told, 'smacks of low
life and the drama.'  Be that as it may,
Alison was now fated to a sample thereof.
</p>

<p>
'Is this your property, Miss Cheyne?'
asked Mrs. Slumpkin De Jobbyns, frigidly,
yet tremulous with passion.
</p>

<p>
'It is; and how came it in your possession,
I demand?' exclaimed Alison.
</p>

<p>
'You demand?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'That matters little.'
</p>

<p>
'It matters very much indeed,' said Alison,
her spirit rising to the occasion; 'a
theft has been committed, else my locket
would have been where I left it, on my
toilet-table.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not attempt to bandy words with
me,' said the lady of the mansion, assuming
a bullying tone.  'But how is it that the
likeness of a friend of this family&mdash;of a
gentleman visitor&mdash;a stranger to a person in
your position, of course&mdash;is in your possession?'
</p>

<p>
'And how do you dare to wear it?' added
Miss De Jobbyns, in a shrill voice of
passion, as her mother tossed the locket to
the feet of Alison, who regained it, and
deliberately placed it in the bosom of her
dress.
</p>

<p>
'What would he&mdash;what must we&mdash;think
of you?' asked Mrs. De Jobbyns, in a louder key.
</p>

<p>
Alison disdained to make any reply.
</p>

<p>
'You are unfit to teach my darlings&mdash;if
you have not corrupted their angel minds
already&mdash;and I request you to quit
Pembridge Square at once.  The housekeeper
will give you what is due in lieu of a month's
notice.'
</p>

<p>
Alison had not been unprepared for this
dictum.  She had heard it without a shock,
and, though certainly dismayed by the sudden
turn her affairs had taken, at once
prepared for and took her departure.
</p>

<p>
She kissed and bade adieu to her two
little pupils, Irene and Iseulte, whose names
had no doubt been suggested by the <i>London
Journal</i>&mdash;a periodical much affected by
Mrs. Slumpkin De Jobbyns in her youth, and
then drove away.
</p>

<p>
The daughter of the house, enraged and
bewildered, knew not precisely <i>what</i> to think
of the affair, but she had a gloomy fear
that so far as Bevil Goring was concerned
her hopes were vanishing into thin air, or
on the eve of being shattered like the
crystal in the basket of Alnaschar, of whom no
doubt she never heard.
</p>

<p>
As the cab quitted the square, Alison
shrank back on perceiving Sir Jasper
Dehorsey (or 'Captain Smith,' as she supposed
him to be) ambling his horse slowly along,
and watching&mdash;as she had before known
him to do&mdash;the windows of the house she
had just quitted for ever; and this incident,
with the memory of Cadbury's cruel and
cowardly letter, filled her heart with horror,
bitterness, and dismay.  She felt so well-nigh
penniless and helpless, too.
</p>

<p>
The summer sunshine was in all its brightness
and glory, but Alison felt as if a mist
surrounded her, and as if the surging of
great waters was in her ears, and she feared
that she might faint.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Almost at the same moment she quitted
Pembridge Square, Bevil Goring entered it
to leave his card, like a well-bred man, on
the De Jobbyns family, whom he devoutly
hoped to find 'not at home.'  Indeed, he
selected the time when he knew that the
mother and daughter were generally 'hairing'
themselves, as they called it, in the
Row, and as he drew near the house he
came suddenly upon a well-known form and figure.
</p>

<p>
'What, Archie! faithful old Archie
Auchindoir&mdash;you here!' he exclaimed, as he
shook the old man's hand with ardour.
'Can it be you?'
</p>

<p>
'By my certie it is, sir,' replied Archie,
'and pleased I am to see a kent face in
this unco human wilderness o' brick wa's.'
</p>

<p>
'And what are you doing here now that
poor Sir Ranald is dead?'
</p>

<p>
'Just what he wad hae dune&mdash;watching
owre missie, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'And where is she, Archie&mdash;where is she?'
</p>

<p>
'Where her forbears wad little like to
see her.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;where&mdash;what?' asked Goring, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'Governess to some brats in the square up bye.'
</p>

<p>
'What square?'
</p>

<p>
'Paimbrig Square,' replied Archie,
adapting the name to his own vernacular.
</p>

<p>
'And whose children?'
</p>

<p>
'A Mrs. De Jobbyns she ca's hersel','
replied Archie, with a contemptuous smirk
on his wrinkled visage.
</p>

<p>
'My God!' exclaimed Goring, growing
red and pale alternately; 'my darling
reduced to this, and all unknown to me!
When came this about?'
</p>

<p>
'A week or two after the master gaed to
his lang hame, sir.  Puir Sir Ranald!' said
Archie, with a break in his voice; 'after a'
he had possest and tint, a kist and a sheet
was a' he needed in the lang rin.'
</p>

<p>
'And you have been watching over her,
you say?' asked Goring, again taking the
old man's hand in his own.
</p>

<p>
'I had a wee pickle siller saved, and I
thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;but never mind; a'
the men in the Mearns can do nae mair
than they may.'
</p>

<p>
'And she is in Pembridge Square now?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p>
He slipped a card with his address into
Archie's hand, and hurried to the house,
where the startling ring he gave the bell
brought an indignant housemaid to the door
speedily as a genii of the Lamp.
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. and Miss De Jobbyns,' she answered,
'was not at home, having just driven off
to the park.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven!&mdash;and Miss Cheyne!'
</p>

<p>
'The governess?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;is she at home?'
</p>

<p>
He was rather curtly informed that she
had been dismissed from her 'sitivation,'
and with her trunk had left the house a
short time ago.
</p>

<p>
'Dismissed and gone&mdash;where?'
</p>

<p>
'No one in the house knew.'
</p>

<p>
He turned away in great agony of mind;
and he had in his haste forgotten to ask
Archie where he lived.  He looked about
him in every direction, but the old man
was nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
And so she would be utterly homeless now.
</p>

<p>
<i>Homeless</i>, and in London&mdash;and she so
young, so tender, and beautiful!
</p>

<p>
Alas! more evils than ever the fatal
Black Hound of Essilmont forebode might
be in store for his Alison now.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
So she was out in the world once more,
with apparently no earthly tie to bind
her to it.
</p>

<p>
'Could I but see Bevil's face once more
and then die!' was her thought, as, blinded
with the hot tears that flowed under her
veil, she was driven through the sunny and
crowded streets of pleasant Bayswater.
</p>

<p>
We have said that the vicar of Chilcote
was now in town; he had brought his
family with him, and was residing in private
apartments not far from Pembridge Square,
and overlooking Kensington Gardens.  Thus
Alison's first thoughts&mdash;indeed her only
resource&mdash;was to throw herself upon him as
she had before intended; but now she was
terrified that, if he naturally made inquiries
of Mrs. De Jobbyns, in the spirit of sourness
or malevolence she might give a very
distorted account of the late episode; and,
indeed, the worthy old man was greatly
disturbed when she told him her simple
tale, as the same ideas occurred to himself,
and he saw all the peril of giving the name
of that irate matron as a reference to
anyone else; and thus for two entire days he
remained in sore perplexity what to do.
</p>

<p>
On the third he began again to question
Alison, whom he kept with his family.
</p>

<p>
'And the portrait which caused this
grotesque disturbance&mdash;the portrait of this
gentleman is that of your <i>fiancé</i>?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Were you engaged to him with your
father's consent?' asked he, suspiciously,
while he regarded her keenly, but not
unkindly, under his shaggy, white eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;to my sorrow be it said,' replied
Alison, with a little hesitation.
</p>

<p>
'That seems wrong&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'He was not rich enough then to suit
papa's views, having little more than his pay.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Then</i>&mdash;is he rich now?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;more than rich&mdash;even wealthy.'
</p>

<p>
'And has he since sought you out?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' sobbed Alison.
</p>

<p>
The vicar shook his white head and groaned.
</p>

<p>
'What is his name?' he asked, and Alison
told him.
</p>

<p>
'Goring&mdash;Goring,' said he, pulling his
nether lip thoughtfully; 'I have heard the
name.  He called on me more than once to
ask your London address, as also did Lord
Cadbury of Cadbury Court; but suspecting
his object, I declined to give it.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, why?'
</p>

<p>
'He is an officer&mdash;and officers are often
wild and unscrupulous fellows.  You are
young, more than most attractive, and are
without a protector&mdash;you understand?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, sir, how you have wronged him!'
</p>

<p>
'I am sorry you think so, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens, you may have parted me
and Bevil for ever!' she exclaimed, in a
voice of intense pathos and sorrow.
</p>

<p>
'Not so, my darling&mdash;I am here!' said
Bevil Goring, who had entered unannounced
by the boarding-house servant, and in a
moment his arms were round her and her
head upon his breast.
</p>

<p>
The darkest hour is always that before
the dawn, it is said, even as clouds are a
prelude to sunshine.
</p>

<p>
It is chiefly in novels and on the stage,
but seldom in real life, that people start and
scream, or faint and fall; so Alison, on
finding herself suddenly face to face with the
object of all her dearest and tenderest
thoughts, felt only her colour change and
her heart give a kind of leap within her
breast; while power so completely seemed to
leave her limbs for some moments that she
would have slid on the carpet but for the
support of Bevil's caressing arms, and for
more than a minute neither spoke, for great
emotion induces silence.
</p>

<p>
So she remained folded in his close
embrace&mdash;content, safe in the shelter of his
arms, with her white face nestling on his
breast, while he showered kisses upon it and
her hair.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Goring,' said the vicar, 'how did
you discover that she was here&mdash;with me?'
</p>

<p>
'She wrote to her old servant whither
she had gone, and he informed me without
delay at my club.  He did not distrust me,
as you, sir, did.'
</p>

<p>
'I trust, Captain Goring, you will pardon
that now, "as all is well that ends well,"
replied the vicar, with a smile, and thinking,
wisely, that he might be rather <i>de trop</i> just
then, he withdrew to another apartment.
</p>

<p>
Goring now then held her at arm's length
to survey her face, it was so long since he
had last looked upon it, and then drew her
close again to his breast.  After a time, he asked,
</p>

<p>
'What is all this that I have been told
about your being a governess&mdash;Alison, love,
tell me?'
</p>

<p>
'I am one now&mdash;at least, I was one, in a
house in Pembridge Square.'
</p>

<p>
'With a family called De Jobbyns&mdash;absurd name!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Is this a riddle&mdash;a joke, or what?' said
he, giving his moustache an almost angry twitch.
</p>

<p>
'No riddle or joke,' replied Alison,
sweetly.  'I seemed to have no friend in the
world to aid me, and I had my bread to earn.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor darling!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;poor indeed.'
</p>

<p>
'And you have left that woman?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'She dismissed me bluntly and coarsely.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Goring, striking the floor
with his spurred heel.
</p>

<p>
'I was dismissed with a month's salary,
because I had been detected wearing your
likeness&mdash;here, in my locket.'
</p>

<p>
A smile that rippled into a laugh spread
over the face of Goring, who, recalling the
mode in which he had been hunted by
mother and daughter, took in the whole
situation.
</p>

<p>
Calm speech and connected utterance
came now to both, and many mutual
explanations were made, and mutual tender
assurances given more than once; for both
had much to relate and to hear; nor with
both&mdash;Alison especially&mdash;without false
impressions that required removal.
</p>

<p>
'And <i>you</i> were actually in Antwerp too!'
exclaimed Alison, when she heard his story.
</p>

<p>
'I traced you there, only to lose you
again&mdash;though many times I must have
passed the door of the very place where
you lay ill.  Oh, my darling, what you must
have endured!'
</p>

<p>
Her transitory emotions of gratitude to
Cadbury for his supposed birthday gift made
Goring laugh again when he saw her wonder
and joy that it had come from himself,
and that she learned the erector of the
marble cross was himself also.  Thus, when
Bevil felt her tears and kisses on his cheek,
he thought that never were gifts so pleasantly
repaid.  With Alison, it would all be
rest hereafter.  'Trials and troubles might
come,' as a writer has it; though further
trials and troubles seemed at a low
computation just then; 'but nothing would tear
her great tree up by the roots again.'
</p>

<p>
Alison felt just a little emotion of shame,
and that she kept to herself.  He had never,
even for an instant, doubted her love
(though he had feared her father's influence),
but she had not been without twinges
of doubt, especially after the day of the
Four-in-Hand meeting by the Serpentine.
</p>

<p>
'How trivial, at first, seem the events
that rule our lives&mdash;that shape our destinies&mdash;our
future,' said Goring.  'Had I not, by
the merest chance, met poor old Archie,
heaven alone knows when I might have
traced you.'
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour passed by, and she forgot
all about the vicar, and even of where
they were.
</p>

<p>
She would recal the past time at Chilcote,
when the first vague emotion of happiness
in his presence and his society&mdash;pleasure
that was almost, strange to say, a kind of
sweet pain&mdash;stole over her; when she was
half-afraid to meet his eye, and when each
stolen glance at the other led to much
secret perturbation of spirit, and when a
touch of the hand seemed to reveal
something that was new, as the glamour of a
first love stole into the hearts of both.
</p>

<p>
How long, long ago, seemed that day on
which they rode with the buckhounds, and
took their fences together side by side.
</p>

<p>
We have not much more to relate, as in
a little time they were to glide pleasantly
away into the unnoticed mass of married
folks; yet to Alison it would be always
delightful to think that she had, at her will
and bidding, a fine manly fellow like Bevil
Goring&mdash;one whom brave men had been
proud to follow&mdash;for she had a keen
appreciation of soldierly renown; and he had
more than a paragraph to his name in the
Annual Army List.
</p>

<p>
We have said, we think, in a preceding
chapter that he wrote to his solicitors at
Gray's Inn an important letter concerning
the acquisition of certain property at
Chilcote; thus when he took Archie Auchindoir
into his service as a personal valet (which
he did forthwith), great was the astonishment
of the old man on first entering his
master's rooms in Piccadilly at what he saw
there, and a cry of joy escaped him and he
almost wept.
</p>

<p>
There hung all the old family pictures,
and there were many a relic and chattel
dearly prized by Sir Ranald and Alison too,
in that superstition of the heart, which few
sensitive or affectionate natures are without.
</p>

<p>
There on the sideboard was the great
silver tankard, the gift of Queen Elizabeth&mdash;the
Bride of the Bruce&mdash;filled with red
wine and emptied on hundreds of occasions
by many successions of Cheynes, even after
the 24th of June, 1314, was nigh forgotten,
and above it hung the portraits of the two
pale, haughty, yet dashing and noble-looking
cavalier brothers, with their love-locks
and long rapiers, who fell in battle for the
King of Scotland, and Archie, greeting them
as old friends, passed his shrivelled hands
tenderly and caressingly over the unconscious
canvas, as if he could scarcely believe
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'A' for her, a' for her&mdash;God bless him!'
he muttered, knowing well why Goring
had rescued these objects from Sir Ranald's
creditors.
</p>

<p>
In Piccadilly, Archie, though rather a
puzzle to Goring's other servants&mdash;his
grooms, coachman, and so forth&mdash;found
himself 'in clover;' and, till the marriage
came off, Alison was to remain with the
family of the vicar, who was to perform the
ceremony, at which little Netty Dalton
figured as a bridesmaid.
</p>

<p>
After all she had undergone, and had
feared she might yet have to undergo, she
was again with Goring&mdash;his strong arms
round her, his lips upon her cheek and
brow!
</p>

<p>
She was at times confused, bewildered&mdash;unable
to comprehend it all.  She could
but lay her head upon his breast and resign
herself to the rapture of the occasion, and
close her eyes as if it would be happiness
even if she opened them no more.
</p>

<p>
How joyous was that mute embrace&mdash;that
love-making without words&mdash;the spell that
neither knew how&mdash;or wished&mdash;to break!
All her past woes, and all her future hopes,
seemed merged in the joy of the present
time; while the pressure of Bevil's hand,
his impassioned murmur, his fond gaze and
studious tenderness, his attention to every
wish and want, caused a sense of joy in her
soul of which it had never been conscious
before.
</p>

<p>
As Jerry said, in his off-hand way, when
he visited them, like Bella and himself, 'they
were in a high state of sentimental gush.'
</p>

<p>
Now she knew that she belonged to
Goring, and he to her, and that the life
and love of each belonged to each other,
that they would be always together till
death&mdash;a distant event, let us hope&mdash;parted
them; that his handsome face would never
smile on another woman as it smiled on
her; and that no other woman's lips would
be touched by him as hers had been on the
day she ceased to be Alison Cheyne of
Essilmont and that ilk.
